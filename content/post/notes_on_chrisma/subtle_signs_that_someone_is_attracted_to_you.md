When engaging in conversations, especially with someone of interest, it can often be challenging to decipher if the interaction is purely friendly or if there is an underlying attraction. While no single sign guarantees romantic interest, observing multiple signs collectively can help provide clarity. Here, we explore six subtle signs that might indicate someone is attracted to you.

### 1. Preening

**Example:** Imagine someone fixing their hair or adjusting their clothing while talking to you.

Preening behaviors such as standing straighter, tidying hair, or adjusting clothes often occur subconsciously. These actions may indicate a desire to groom oneself for someone they find attractive. When noticing these behaviors repeated, it may signal interest.

### 2. Lingering or Drag Touch

Touching can signify attraction, but not all touches convey the same meaning.

- **Lingering Touch:** When a person maintains contact longer than necessary, such as dragging a hand across an arm during a hug, it might imply more than platonic feelings.

- **Example:** Imagine someone giving a hug and then slowly dragging their hand across your back as they step away.

### 3. Unnecessary Touches

Frequent, seemingly insignificant touches can also imply attraction. If someone regularly makes contact during conversation, like lightly touching your arm while speaking, it hints at interest.

- **Example:** A person may touch your shoulder each time they emphasize a point.

### 4. Body Orientation

Where someone directs their body can indicate their engagement level.

- **Example:** In a group, if someone positions their body perpendicular to their chair or consistently angles towards you, they are likely more engaged with you than others present.

### 5. Leaning In

Leaning closer during exchanges, whether talking or laughing, can reflect a subconscious desire to close the distance between you.

- **Example:** During laughter, a person leans towards rather than away from you.

### 6. Smiling Eye Dart

This often happens when someone is caught looking, followed by a bashful smile as they glance away. It suggests they were intentionally gazing at you due to attraction or curiosity.

- **Example:** Catching a person watching you and observing them smile sheepishly upon realizing they've been spotted.

Understanding these subtle signs can provide insight into someone's feelings towards you, offering an added layer of awareness in social interactions. Engage and observe these cues to gain a better understanding of underlying emotions.

Always remember, subtle signs can provide indications, but their interpretations depend heavily on the context and individual personalities involved. Therefore, approach any assumptions with a touch of caution and a lot of curiosity!
