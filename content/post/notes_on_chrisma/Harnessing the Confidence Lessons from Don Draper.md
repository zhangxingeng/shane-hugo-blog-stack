Don Draper is often viewed as the epitome of confidence on the popular TV show Mad Men. His character vividly encapsulates the two types of confidence: external and internal. Grasping both can significantly elevate one's ability to navigate social, professional, and personal pursuits. Here's how:

## The Power of Body Language  

Don Draper demonstrates that one's physical presence can be a powerful tool. His relaxed body language speaks volumes about his confidence:

- **Example:** Don often sits asymmetrically, spreading himself out comfortably, which subconsciously signals comfort and authority.
- Use open and expansive postures. For instance, stand with feet at least shoulder-width apart or lean with an arm draped over a chair.

### Owning the Space

Don moves freely across environments, signaling comfort and ownership.

- Adapt similar behaviors by confidently navigating spaces as if they are familiar territories.

### Attention Dynamics

Draper skillfully flips power dynamics by making others work for his attention:

- He leans back even while conversing with clients, subtly flipping the attentional balance.

**Example:** In scenarios such as pitch meetings, maintain a relaxed demeanor to increase others' engagement.

## Mastery of Eye Contact

Draper uses eye contact as a strategic tool:

- He limits eye contact initially to intrigue and then uses piercing eyes to reinforce a point.

**Example:** Apply this by reserving strong eye contact for critical parts of conversations to emphasize your point effectively.

## The Art of Non-Reactivity

Staying calm under pressure is another staple of Draper's confidence:

- Remaining non-reactive during high-stress situations conveys solidity and power.

**Example:** In tense situations, like when a client dislikes your proposal, pause and think through your response instead of reacting impulsively.

## The Strength of Not Convincing

Instead of persuading aggressively, Draper frames himself as an equal:

- Convey mutual selection in negotiations; you are evaluating them as much as they evaluate you.

**Example:** In business negotiations, present yourself as an equal partner instead of overly eager, conveying self-confidence and authority.

## The Deep Layer of Confidence

Ultimately, Draper's confidence stems from an internal belief that no matter what happens, he will be okay.

### Living the Truth

- Honesty, even when it comes with personal costs, leads to authentic strength.
- Draper's character evolves when he reveals personal vulnerabilities, transcending superficial confidence.

**Example:** Emulate this layer of confidence by speaking your truth in personal or professional settings, reassuring yourself that you'll remain resilient.

## Conclusion

Blending external projection with internal assurance can transform social interactions from stressful tasks to enjoyable encounters. Don Draper's character showcases how embracing authenticity while mastering key communication skills can foster substantial self-assurance. It's a call to embody a stoic composure while feeling deeply and living honestly.

Real confidence is not about perfection but about resilience and authenticity. Thus, every encounter becomes not a test to survive but an opportunity to thrive.
