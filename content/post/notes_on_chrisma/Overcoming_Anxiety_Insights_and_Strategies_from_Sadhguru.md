Stress, worry, and anxiety affect the majority of people at some point in their lives. However, insightful perspectives can greatly help in overcoming these feelings. Here, strategies inspired by Sadhguru can assist in promptly managing anxiety, as well as altering one's mindset to prevent it from arising in the first place.

## Fast Acting Physical Techniques

### Open-Palm Gesticulation

Often observed when Sadhguru speaks, the act of revealing one's palms is more than a mere gesture. **Example:** Sadhguru reveals his palms while speaking, creating a relaxed atmosphere. This action can reduce anxiety as it counters the bodily tension that comes with it.

- **Benefits:**
  - Relaxes your body language
  - Signals safety to your nervous system
  - Breaks the cycle of anxiety-induced tension

To utilize this technique:

- Open your hands to expose the insides of your elbows.
- Tilt your head slightly to show more of your throat.
- Uncross your legs.

These small actions can be a covert and effective method to combat anxiousness in stressful moments.

### Using Silence Instead of Filler Words

In situations where you need to speak while anxious, replacing filler words like "um" and "ah" with silence can be beneficial.

- **Problem with Filler Words:**
  - They prevent proper breathing.
  - They result in rushed speech.

**Example:** Sadhguru often pauses before responding to questions, providing himself time to think clearly and breathe.

**Practice Tip:** Set a goal to exclude filler words in your conversations for a day, thereby creating more silence and time to breathe, thus calming nerves.

## Mindset Shifts for Lasting Change

### Refrain Phrases to Shift Perspective

Refrain phrases can reframe anxiety-inducing thoughts and make them more manageable.

- **Example:** Sadhguru uses the reminder that everyone will eventually become topsoil, which minimizes the significance of fears and mistakes.

- **Strategy:** Develop a personal refrain phrase such as:
  - "Will I care about this in 10 years?"
  - Asking what would minimize regrets looking back at life in old age.

These phrases redirect the mind from immediate anxieties to broader perspectives.

### Acceptance Prior to Change

Changing others can often drive anxiety. A mindset of **acceptance first, change later** can alleviate unnecessary stress.

- **Example:** When interacting with Gordon Ramsay, Sadhguru laughed and accepted the initial disruption, then calmly corrected him without conflict.

- **Practice Tip:** Accept situations as they are, which often reduces conflict-induced stress and positions you for more effective change.

### Relying on Internal Rather than External for Happiness

Anxiety often stems from the fear that external circumstances dictate one's happiness.

- **Belief Example:** Job interviews or dates often trigger anxiety because of the perceived make-or-break stakes of happiness.

Sadhguru suggests internal happiness shouldn't depend on external outcomes.

- **Insight:** Even material success doesnâ€™t guarantee happiness as seen from leaders and celebrities like Brad Pitt expressing struggles despite immense achievements.

By realizing true contentment comes from within, one can lessen the pressure and thus reduce anxiety.

**Example:** Reflect on the joylessly driving affluent individuals in luxury cars as Sadhguru suggests, reinforcing that external achievements alone aren't the source of true happiness.

In conclusion, adopting these physical techniques and mindset shifts can foster well-being, reduce anxiety, and promote a more serene state of mind. Embrace the inner journey over external circumstances, and enjoy a more peaceful and anxiety-free existence.
