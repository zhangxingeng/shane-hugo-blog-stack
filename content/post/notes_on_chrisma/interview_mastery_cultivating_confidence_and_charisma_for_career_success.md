## Mastering Interviews with Confidence and Charisma

The interview chair is one of those pivotal places where confidence and charisma can make all the difference. This is the moment to show that you are not only qualified but also someone who would be a joy to work with. The aim here is to help you prepare and excel in any interview setting.

### Mindset: View From the 90-Year-Old Chair

One of the greatest obstacles to confidence is the immense pressure to succeed. Alleviate this stress by *zooming out* and viewing your interview from the perspective of a 90-year-old you. While the interview is important, it's unlikely to rank in the topmost critical moments of your life. This mindset shift can reduce pressure and bolster your confidence during the interview.

## Preparing for the Interview: Framework for Answering Questions

To effectively prepare for an interview, creating a framework for approaching potential questions is essential:

1. **Record Pivotal Moments:**
   - Document ten pivotal experiences from your career or studies, highlighting strengths relevant to the position.

2. **Assign Adjectives:**
   - Next to each experience, list adjectives that reflect both positive traits and areas for improvement.

3. **Select Core Stories:**
   - From these experiences, choose the three to five that best align with the job, reflecting both strengths and self-awareness of weaknesses.

**Example:** If managing a lemonade stand showcased your entrepreneurial spirit and disorganization in handling finances, describe how you learned to improve those skills.

## The Power of Storytelling

Rather than simply listing qualifications, connect with your interviewer using stories:

- Identify and prepare stories with *Setting, Problem, Solution, and Result*.

**Example:**

- **Setting:** Passionate about salsa dancing but lacking a local club.
- **Problem:** Challenges in initiating a dance club without sufficient resources.
- **Solution:** Partnered with another student already drawing interest.
- **Result:** Successfully launched a ballroom dance club pulling a significant crowd.

These stories naturally showcase your skills and adaptability beyond a resume.

## The Interview Day

When the wait is over and you step into the building, remember: *the interview starts as soon as you cross the threshold*. Every interaction matters, including those with receptionists and other staff.

### Making Great Impressions

- Display open body language.
- Establish eye contact and offer a genuine smile.
- Transition smoothly into your prepared stories when asked about yourself or specific competencies.

### Thoughtful Inquiries

Consider concluding the meeting with an insightful question that paints a picture of your success. One such exemplary inquiry is:

> "Assuming I am offered this position, what achievements would make you look back in a year's time saying this was an excellent hire?"

This portrays you as a forward-thinker and encourages the interviewer to imagine you successfully filling the role.

By following these strategies, you position yourself as a memorable and engaging candidate, ready to leave a positive, lasting impression.
