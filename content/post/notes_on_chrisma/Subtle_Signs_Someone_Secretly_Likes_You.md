Understanding body language can be an invaluable skill, especially when trying to decipher whether someone is interested in you or just being friendly. Here are five subtle signs that could indicate someone secretly likes you.

### 1. The Marilyn

The "Marilyn" refers to a signature gesture famously associated with Marilyn Monroe, where a woman tilts her head and exposes her neck. This move indicates engagement and an attempt to release pheromones.

**Example:** When a woman laughs and tilts her head to the side, exposing her neck, it usually signals interest. Jennifer Lawrence was seen doing this with Chris Pratt, which demonstrated engagement and attraction.

### 2. Crossing into the Intimate Zone

People naturally gravitate towards subjects, topics, or individuals they like. Pay attention to how close someone stands to you. There are four spatial zones:

- Public Zone: about seven feet away.
- Social Zone: five feet away.
- Personal Zone: three feet away.
- Intimate Zone: around 18 inches away.

When someone moves into your intimate zone deliberately, it is a clear cue of attraction.

**Example:** Consider Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt during the early stages of their relationship, where they constantly moved closer into each other's intimate spaces.

### 3. Toes: The True Windows to the Soul

While eyes are often referred to as the windows to the soul, toes are much more telling. They naturally angle towards what we desire or have interest in.

**Example:** In a casting video for "Step Up," Jenna Dewan was observed angling her body towards Channing Tatum, demonstrating interest through her toes and body direction.

### 4. The "Touch Me"

When a person enjoys being touched or is signaling they want to be touched, they may subconsciously touch that part of their body themselves. For instance, touching the neck, lips, or hair could be such cues.

**Example:** Nicole Kidman subtly touched her hair and leaned in during an interview with Jimmy Fallon, suggesting attraction through subconscious gestures.

### 5. The Saver Smile

A "Saver Smile" is a genuine smile that spreads slowly across the face, reaching up to the eyes. It's an indication of genuine delight and interest.

**Example:** Jessica Biel displayed a genuine saver smile during an interview with Justin Timberlake, which contrasted with a more reserved smile when speaking with Conan O'Brien.

Recognizing these signs can give insight into whether someone is attracted to you. Subtle changes in behavior and body language reveal much more than words often do. Pay attention, and you might just pick up on some of these silent signals yourself.
