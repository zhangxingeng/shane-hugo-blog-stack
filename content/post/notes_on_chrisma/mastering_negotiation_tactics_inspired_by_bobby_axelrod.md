The fictional character Bobby Axelrod from the television series "Billions" demonstrates negotiation skills that can seem nothing short of miraculous. With more money and power than most can imagine, his negotiation tactics are worth analyzing for those looking to improve their own skills in any negotiation setting—from the boardroom to personal relationships. Below are some of Bobby's key negotiation tactics, backed by real-world applicability:

## Understanding Needs Before Negotiating

One of Bobby’s most potent tactics is thoroughly understanding what the other party needs.

**Example:** At one point, Bobby renegotiates a building purchase, initially offering $25 million but confidently reducing it to $9 million after realizing the sellers’ precarious financial state.

### Actionable Tip

To employ this tactic yourself, ensure you conduct comprehensive research on the other party's needs and constraints.

- If unsure what the other party desires, simply ask directly. For instance, when aiming for a salary increase, ask what you need to achieve to earn the raise, rather than guessing your manager’s expectations.

## Using Body Language for Influence

Bobby’s awareness of body language as a persuasive tool is profound. He positions himself to convey power and confidence.

- Standing while others sit makes people subconsciously respect and perceive him as powerful.
- Conversely, when he wants to appear confident and unthreatened, he sits, making others come to him.

### Practical Tip

Use your physical positioning to direct the focus of the negotiation:

- Stand to claim attention in a high-pressure scenario.
- Sit at eye level when fostering collaboration, such as during team meetings or one-on-one discussions.

## Creating Urgency with Explosive Offers

Bobby frequently limits others' choices to "now or never," creating urgency.

**Example:** Offering $63 million in cash with a ticking clock, which compels the counterpart to decide swiftly without exploring alternatives.

### Word of Caution

While this can yield quick results, it may also result in resentment. Reserve explosive offers for situations where swift decisions are essential, and be aware of their potential long-term costs.

## The Power of Walking Away

Bobby doesn’t cave under pressure to accept unfavorable terms. He often walks away from deals if they don't align with his objectives.

**Example:** When an investor attempts to alter an agreement at the last moment, Bobby walks away, affirming his unwillingness to settle.

### Mindset Shift

Adopting the mindset that numerous options are always available can empower easier departures from poor deals. Consider lining up multiple offers before entering serious negotiations.

## Thinking Long-Term

Bobby aims to secure short-term wins even if it potentially harms long-term relationships.

**Example:** Trying to shortchange an employee, Taylor, by offering them half of their original request, despite Taylor generating extensive profit for the company.

### Strategic Advice

View negotiations as iterative. Aim for fair deals that incentivize future collaborations instead of solely maximizing immediate gains.

In summary, while Bobby Axelrod's negotiation abilities appear larger than life, extracting essential strategies from his fictional exploits can offer real-world benefits, provided they are applied thoughtfully with ethical conscience and consideration of the bigger picture.
