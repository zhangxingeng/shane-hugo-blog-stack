In the complex world of *Game of Thrones*, charisma plays a pivotal role in the survival and influence of its characters. This analysis ranks various characters by their charisma, interpreting it as their ability to persuade, influence, and manipulate others in the treacherous landscapes of Westeros and beyond.

### F-Tier: The Charisma-less

**Example**: Gregor Clegane - Silent as the grave and more a tool for Tywin Lannister than a conversationalist, "The Mountain" may survive atrocities, but he's far from charismatic.

- **Viserys Targaryen**: Believed himself powerful despite having nothing to back it up. His hubris led to an early demise, proving that perceived charisma without substance is fatal.
- **Theon Greyjoy**: Notoriously poor decision-making, sacking Winterfell only to lose it, and being captured by Ramsay. Despite eventual redemption, his early failings place him here.

### D-Tier: The Almost Charismatic

**Example**: Joffrey Baratheon - Initially charming and persuasive to Sansa, his lack of humility and abusive nature saw his charisma wane as quickly as it waxed.

- **Cersei Lannister**: Successfully stays in power but due to destabilizing others, not true charisma. Her ruthlessness isn’t charisma—it’s intimidation.
- **Ned Stark**: Honourable but naive, his ill-fated trust in Littlefinger and lack of political acumen led to his downfall.

### C-Tier: Momentarily Persuasive

**Example**: Jon Snow - While liked personally, his inability to communicate critical decisions led to his downfall, stabbed by his own men due to poor persuasion.

- **Daenerys Targaryen**: Inspiring at times, yet some interactions betray a cold facade. Her command is aided more by dragons than personal charisma.

### B-Tier: The Respectably Charismatic

**Example**: Ygritte - Surviving in a harsh world with a good judge of character, she saw through Jon's ruse but was too compromised by emotion to act decisively.

- **Oberyn Martell**: Exuded charm and allure, politically savvy, but fell prey to hubris—an often deadly combination in *Game of Thrones*.

### A-Tier: The Power Players

**Example**: Tywin Lannister - A political master with a knack for making others take the fall for his plots. His orchestration of the Red Wedding demonstrated his strategic genius.

- **Olenna Tyrell**: Defying a patriarchal society, executing a coup in regicide with zero suspicion—a masterstroke of influence.
- **Margaery Tyrell**: Manipulates through charm, gaining favour and subtly controlling Joffrey by playing to his fantasies.

### S-Tier: Self-Made Charisma Champions

**Example**: Littlefinger - The schemer supreme, beloved in the books, his machinations and subtlety rendered him a near-invisible puppet master.

- **Varys**: From "nothing" to master of whispers, adept at maneuvering political landscapes despite Littlefinger's interference.
- **Mance Rayder**: United an array of opposing factions north of the Wall, a feat of charisma against impossible odds.
