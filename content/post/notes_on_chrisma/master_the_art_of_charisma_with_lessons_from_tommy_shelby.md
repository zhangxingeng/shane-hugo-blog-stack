Tommy Shelby, the magnetic character from *Peaky Blinders*, captivates many with his unique blend of introversion and charisma. While not every aspect of Tommy's personality needs to be emulated, there are several powerful habits that can help anyone command respect and influence others.

## Commanding Presence through Movement

Tommy Shelby demonstrates his commanding presence through slow, relaxed movements. His unrushed demeanor gives the impression of confidence and control, even in tense situations.

- **Example:** When Tommy moves slowly, it communicates that he is unfazed by intimidation, which elevates his status in social interactions.

### Cultivate Relaxed Body Language

To appear more confident, focus on:

- Moving deliberately and at a steady pace
- Maintaining a relaxed posture
- Avoiding fidgety gestures

## Power of Eye Contact

Tommy is known for his strategic use of eye contact, particularly during conflicts. However, it's crucial to understand the implications of eye contact in different contexts.

- Hold eye contact for confidence
- Look away if you need to de-escalate
- Break eye contact to the side rather than downwards to avoid appearing submissive

## Non-Reactivity: The Art of Staying Calm

Tommy's confidence often stems from his non-reactive nature in hostile situations. By staying calm and composed, he projects strength and control.

- **Example:** Even when faced with extreme threats, Tommy's non-reactivity signals his internal confidence and steady trust in his own capabilities.

## Commanding Group Attention

When Tommy speaks to larger groups, he scales his gestures and presence to match his audience's size. This ensures that he holds their attention without having to raise his voice.

- Use broader gestures
- Maintain a strong, clear voice
- Project your voice but avoid shouting

## Speaking with Conviction

Tommy's word choice and tone exude conviction and certainty. He avoids phrases like "I hope" or "I want", opting instead for decisive language such as "I will."

- **Example:** Tommy's tone is declarative and firm, never ending statements with a questioning inflection.

### Slow Speaking Cadence

Tommy’s deliberate speaking pace and use of pauses help maintain attention and emphasize important points.

- Speak slowly and clearly
- Use pauses strategically
- Avoid rushing through sentences

## Master the "Carrot and Stick"

Tommy effectively uses the "carrot and stick" approach by understanding his associate’s desires and fears.

- **Example:** At work, instead of merely asking for a raise, state what additional value you can bring and align this with your supervisor's goals. Demonstrate your value with measurable improvements over time, while preparing alternative job offers to strengthen your position.

Well, while avoiding any drastic measures—no need to resort to Tommy's more dramatic tactics—these principles can be effectively adapted for professional and personal environments to improve one's influence and charisma.
