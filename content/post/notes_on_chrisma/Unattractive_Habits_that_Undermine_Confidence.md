**Unattractive habits** can subtly undermine one's perceived confidence. Here's how to identify and change these habits to command more respect in conversations.

## Avoidant Body Language

Avoidant body language can instantly make you appear less confident. Examples include:

- Hanging your head
- Not making eye contact
- Facing away from the speaker

**Example:** On a first date, avoidant and nervous body language such as stuttering can hinder connection and respect.

**Solution:** Adopt open and expansive body language to strengthen your first impression. Consider the confident postures of personalities like John Cena and Matthew McConaughey. They employ key body language principles:

- Smiling
- Maintaining eye contact
- Keeping shoulders back
- Taking up space

Remember, the cues to focus on are "**open and expand**."

## Tentative Talking

Speaking tentatively with filler words and stuttering detracts from confidence.

**Example:** Kristen Stewart once struggled with filler words and hesitancy discussing her role in Seberg.

**Solution:** Pause and think before responding. Embrace the silence as powerful moments of thought. Practicing this can transform these pauses into moments that build anticipation in conversations.

To reduce filler words:

1. **Record yourself** answering simple questions.
2. Progress to more complex ones.
3. **Review recordings** to improve gradually.

## First Instinct Questions

Immediately defaulting to common questions can stall engaging conversations, especially with high-status individuals.

**Solution:** Ask unique and enthusiastic questions that make the other person light up.

**Example:** Instead of asking routine questions, ask about unique experiences or passions, such as a personal highlight in designing a new home.

## Recovering from Missed Jokes

Retreating after a joke falls flat is common but can suggest a lack of confidence.

**Solution:** Laugh at yourself or make light of the failed joke.

**Example:** A news anchor recovered from a joke flop by simply laughing at the ineffectiveness of the joke.

## Unnecessary Bragging

Injecting boasts into conversations can undermine genuine connection and appear insecure.

**Example:** The Liver King's apologetic video mentioned wealth unnecessarily, detracting from sincerity.

**Solution:** Allow interesting facts about your life to arise organically during storytelling, as demonstrated by Jamie Foxx when discussing his encounter with Kanye West.

## Prioritizing Agreeableness over Authenticity

Being overly agreeable can undercut self-esteem and confidence.

**Solution:** Practice speaking truth to power, even if it involves uncomfortable truths.

**Example:** Characters like Don Draper embody confidence by being straightforward, even with hard truths.

To build this habit:

- **Start small**, being honest about minor things.
- Gradually progress to larger truths to build confidence progressively.

Improving confidence is a journey, one that involves identifying and replacing detrimental habits with more empowering ones. By doing so, individuals can not only bolster their self-esteem but also cultivate respectful and memorable interactions.
