Margaery Tyrell might be one of the most underrated players in "Game of Thrones," and it's unfortunate she meets her end prematurely in the show. Her journey, however, provides us with profound lessons in building rapport and behaving with charisma in the real world. Below are some of her exceptional abilities that one can learn from.

### Building Rapport with Body Language

Margaery displays an incredible talent for creating rapport effortlessly—primarily through her adept use of body language. She often places herself physically on the same side as the person she aims to influence. This subtle move is distinct from the likes of Tywin Lannister, who uses his body language to dominate and intimidate.

* **Example:** When engaging with Joffrey, Margaery stands beside him, contrasting Tywin's technique of hovering to overwhelm.

Standing next to someone allows you to enter their space without appearing confrontational. In Western culture, personal space extends more out front than to the sides.

* **Example:** In a crowded restaurant or bar, standing shoulder to shoulder with someone is less invasive than standing face-to-face.

### Effective Use of Physical Contact

Another of Margaery's strategies includes using physical contact. While not always directly applicable across genders, the principle of signaling warmth through touch remains potent.

* **Example:** Margaery engages Joffrey with affectionate touches to promote intimacy and comfort.

### Engaging Others in Their Interests

Margaery excels at getting people to discuss their passions, fostering a bond.

* **Example:** She expresses interest in Joffrey's crossbow, which flatters him by playing into his interests.

Men often engage through discussing how things work, while women may prefer sharing emotional experiences.

### Active Listening and Empathy

Margaery demonstrates a keen ability to listen actively. She expresses a genuine interest (or convincingly feigned interest) in others' opinions.

* **Example:** She tells Tommen she wants to know him completely, demonstrating attentiveness and interest.

When individuals are hesitant to share, Margaery often vulnerably shares something personal first.

* **Example:** She divulges a childhood nickname story to Sansa, encouraging a reciprocal reveal.

### Mastering Empathy without Agreement

Empathy doesn't equate to agreement, but it does involve seeing the world through another’s eyes. This skill positions one to influence and guide.

* **Example:** She validates Joffrey’s twisted ideas without endorsing them.

### Pacing and Leading: A Path to Influence

After aligning with another's worldview, Margaery utilizes the technique of Pacing and Leading to guide them effectively.

* **Example:** Her crowning moment with Joffrey occurs when she opens the doors to the adulation of King's Landing’s citizens, using their love to influence him.

### Giving a Reputable Image

Crafting an appealing persona for someone encourages them to live up to it.

* **Example:** Margaery praises Joffrey's minor courtesies to stress his thoughtfulness.

### Conclusion

Margaery Tyrrell remains a strikingly adept figure in persuasion and charisma. Her ability to build rapport, empathize, and subtly influence stands as a lesson in personal interaction. However, a final reminder is warranted—"don’t anger Cersei." Her intuition in building relationships is exceptional, forming a significant aspect of her understated prowess.

Margaery’s tactics highlight how one can effectively engage with and influence others, making her a formidable player in both the game of thrones and real-life interactions.
