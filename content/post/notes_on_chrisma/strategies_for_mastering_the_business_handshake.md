A handshake is more than just a greeting; it's a subtle dance of first impressions, trust, and non-verbal communication. Whether in a political arena or a business meeting, a handshake can set the tone for the relationship moving forward.

### The Handshake Tactics of Donald Trump

Donald Trump's handshake technique, particularly his infamous 19-second handshake with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, intrigued many with its unique elements. Here are the notable tactics often associated with Trump's handshake:

- **The Yank**: Off-balances the other person, discouraging them from taking control of the interaction. Often they become suspicious or hesitant as a result.

  **Example:** A handshake incorporating a sudden tug toward oneself, potentially diminishing the recipient's confidence.

- **The Wrist Bend and Lift**: Twisting the other's wrist places them in a discomforting position, mirroring the impact of the yank by fostering hesitation and suspicion.

  **Example:** While shaking hands, if one were to tilt the other's wrist while lifting upward, it could disrupt their composure.

- **The Hand Tap**: A seemingly benign gesture, perceived as good-natured unless preceded by more aggressive moves like the yank. Here, it serves as a post-script of reassurance, akin to saying "no hard feelings."

  **Example:** Following a forceful handshake, a light pat on the hand acts as a gesture of conciliation.

These handshake components aim for a dominating presence under the guise of cordiality. The psychological entrapment known as the "double bind" where someone like Shinzo Abe is complimented for "having strong hands," might negate the perceived combative nature of the handshake.

### The Standard Business Handshake

While Trump's handshake might be unique to him, the average professional handshake often needs refining. Here’s how to ensure your handshake communicates the right message:

- **Purpose**: Handshakes should build trust, not demonstrate dominance. Keep it warm and assertive.

- **Common Practice**: In professional settings, handshakes are the standard across different genders and hierarchical levels.

### Mechanics of a Business Handshake

Proper handshaking methods can prevent awkward encounters, and here's how you can master them:

- **Timing**: Offer a handshake as you approach, about two to three steps away, to avoid confusion.

  **Example:** Extending your hand early communicates readiness and avoids missed connections.

- **Finger Positioning**: Keep your fingers straight to allow a smooth engagement with the other person’s web between their thumb and index finger.

  **Example:** A straightened hand presents a broad target, avoiding the "dead fish" grip.

- **Vertical Angle**: Approach the handshake with a balanced vertical hand. Facing the individual prevents a tilted palm which often leads to fingertips meeting fists.

  **Example:** Standing square with the individual gives a full-hand connection.

- **Connection and Squeeze**: Only squeeze after the webs of both hands meet to avoid any discomfort often caused by early finger squeezing.

  **Example:** Connect firmly with the palm before applying any pressure.

### Final Tips

Accidents happen—missed handshakes are not the end of the world. If someone misses your extended hand, an assertive gesture will ensure your intention is clear, and doing a quick solo hand shake recovery can save from further awkwardness.

Master these elements to strengthen business connections, making each handshake a gateway to positive professional dynamics and not a tug-of-war for supremacy.
