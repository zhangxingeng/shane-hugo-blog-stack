Meeting someone new can be thrilling, but keeping their attention with your texts can be a whole different ballgame. Amidst a sea of others vying for her attention, how does one stand out? Here are five essential texting strategies designed to capture interest and lead to an in-person meetup.

### 1. Be Memorable in Her Contacts

Ensure you're not just another name in the phonebook by saving your number with a memorable twist related to how you met.

- **Example**: If you met on a dance floor, save your contact as "Dave Amazing Dancer" or "Dave Booty Shaker." This light-hearted and fun introduction can start each interaction with a smile and a reminder of your shared connection.

### 2. Start with a Cheeky Text

Initiate the texting conversation on a humorous and memorable note by sending yourself a message from her phone as if she texted you.

- **Example**: "OMG... dream come true. I'm so happy I finally have your number, you handsome devil." Later, when you respond with "Awwww, you're so sweet. You didn’t have to say that," it not only gives her a chuckle but sets a playful tone for future exchanges.

### 3. Create Emotional Engagement

Avoid mundane logistical texts. Inject personality and emotional engagement with a touch of humor or charm.

- **Example**: Instead of "How was your night? Did you meet any interesting people?" try "Did you meet any other handsome gentlemen at the bar?" The latter not only asks the same question but does so with a bit of cheek, making it more likely to receive a response.

- **Rule of Thumb**: Ask yourself, "On a scale of one to ten, how much emotion does this text evoke?" Aim for at least a three.

### 4. Employ Callback Humor

Utilize callback humor by referencing a funny or memorable moment you shared when meeting. It's an effective way to create a unique and entertaining dialogue.

- **Example**: If you had a humorous experience while dancing, later text, "FYI, my dance team took home the trophy last night for busting the best moves!" Just ensure not to overuse the same joke, or it may backfire.

### 5. Present Exciting Plans

When it comes time to ask her out, ensure your invitation is exciting and low-pressure. This approach significantly boosts the chance of a 'yes.'

- **Example**: Suggest meeting for a dynamic or unusual experience like a salsa dancing class, a visit to a cool mixology bar, or hunting down the world’s best ice cream cone. These plans are not only intriguing but relieve her of the pressures and potential awkwardness of a formal dinner.

By following these five texting tips, you increase your odds of progressing smoothly from getting her number to setting up that first date. Remember, these strategies aim to create fun, engaging, and memorable conversations that stand out amidst the usual humdrum of texts she receives.
