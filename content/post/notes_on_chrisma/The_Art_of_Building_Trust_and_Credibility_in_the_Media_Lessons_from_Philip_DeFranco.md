In a landscape where mainstream news and allegations of fake news often collide, Philip DeFranco stands out as a notably trustworthy figure. This post explores why DeFranco is viewed as one of the most credible news personalities and what we can learn from his approach.

## Embracing and Admitting Bias

**Example:** In a discussion about net neutrality, DeFranco openly shared his stance on the issue, specifying that he viewed the internet as a utility requiring open access — a clear expression of bias. This transparency differentiates him from many others in the media who project an aura of objectivity but are internally biased.

The openness about one's bias, as demonstrated by DeFranco, might seem counterintuitive at first. However, people are often more suspicious of those who pretend not to have biases. DeFranco's honesty about his biases builds trust, as audiences know they can rely on his factual reporting despite not always agreeing with his personal views.

## Acting Against Self-Interest

DeFranco is known for prioritizing principle over profit, a trait that enhances his credibility. He has stood firm on covering controversial topics even when it affected his ad revenue on YouTube.

**Example:** On one occasion, he pulled all ads from a video discussing child abuse, stating that he did not wish to seem as though he was exploiting the situation for profit.

This self-sacrificial approach builds a strong trust base because it signals authenticity and integrity.

## Selecting Principles Over Profits

Launching his news channel independently, DeFranco turned down lucrative offers from major networks, opting instead for crowdfunding to maintain creative freedom and avoid corporate interference.

**Example:** Instead of aligning with a big network, he chose to build a subscriber-supported model, ensuring that he retains control over the content.

For those seeking to emulate DeFranco, the belief that honest expression outweighs short-term gains is key. Integrity leads to long-term respect and trust — invaluable in media and personal relationships alike.

## Engaging in Dialogue and Admitting Change

True to his values, DeFranco actively engages with his audience's feedback. He frequently revisits topics based on new insights or valid arguments from his viewers.

**Example:** A discussion about shopping at minority-owned businesses inspired DeFranco to acknowledge a viewer's argument he had overlooked, demonstrating a willingness to evolve his perspectives.

This willingness to engage and adapt fosters a genuine conversation, where differing viewpoints are respected and considered.

## Rigorous Research and Fact-Checking

DeFranco also advocates for comprehensive research, critiquing major outlets for misinformation or skewed narratives.

**Example:** He notably called out Wired's portrayal of PewDiePie as a Nazi sympathizer due to their neglect in evaluating the broader context of the jokes made by PewDiePie.

This diligence enhances DeFranco's reputation as a reliable news source, reinforcing the importance of due diligence over sensationalism.

## Conclusion: Living a Principled Life

Adherence to personal principles, even when challenging, sets someone apart from the crowd. By valuing honesty, open dialogue, and self-expression, individuals can achieve authenticity and trustworthiness akin to Philip DeFranco's approach in the news world.

While living by one's principles may incur immediate costs, it results in a reputation of trust and reliability, which is invaluable. Consider how your principles align with your actions, and what changes may need to be made to truly live by them in your own life.
