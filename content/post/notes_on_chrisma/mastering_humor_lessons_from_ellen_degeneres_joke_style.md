Ellen DeGeneres has long been hailed as one of television's most endearing hosts. Her humor style plays a significant role in instantly winning over both guests and audiences alike. By examining her approach to comedy, one can learn how to employ similar techniques to enhance likability. Here’s a closer look at the various joke styles Ellen uses and how you can apply them in your daily interactions.

### The Art of Self-Deprecating Humor

One of Ellen's signature styles is self-deprecating humor, where she makes herself the target of her jokes.

**Example:** When asked about shoes from '88, Ellen quipped, "I've shoes that are, like, from '88. (audience laughs) I still have a couple of vests that I wear from '88." Here, she humorously acknowledges how dated her fashion might be.

This style of humor works by making oneself vulnerable, which in turn makes others feel comfortable and appreciative.

### Poking Fun Without Offense

Ellen occasionally engages in gentle teasing or "poking fun", usually in a manner that the subject is unlikely to take personally.

**Example:** Commenting on Amy Adams not attending college, Ellen said, "Amy Adams, you went to college, right? No. Okay, we'll let… who cares?" This joke is playful because, despite the tease, it's grounded in Amy's undeniable success, making it unlikely to cause offense.

### Ego Boosters: Making Others Feel Good

A more affirming style is the "ego booster," where humor highlights someone's positive traits in a humorous manner.

**Example:** Ellen commended an actress for being in two Oscar-nominated films, playfully suggesting it was "selfish." This joke contains a compliment wrapped in humor, enhancing the person's perception of being admired.

### The Role of Silly Surprises

Silly surprises are jokes that rely on randomness or the unexpected to evoke laughter. These can be particularly infectious as they're often light-hearted and universally enjoyed.

**Example:** Ellen jokingly told Will Smith he had to take over hosting the Oscars for her, adding an element of surprise to the conversation.

### Building a Playful Persona

Ellen's ability to craft these jokes isn't accidental. She incorporates playfulness into her life through everyday rituals and practices that prime her humor, such as her mint toss and impromptu dance routines during her shows.

To bring more playfulness into your life, consider:

- **Starting the day with a playful ritual** like tossing a mint or similar small challenge.
- **Incorporating movement** – dancing or any form of expressive physical activity can boost mood and enhance humorous interactions.
- **Embracing games** – introducing games or playful activities, even in a social setting, can foster a fun, relaxed atmosphere.

By incorporating these humorous styles into everyday interactions and building a playful routine, individuals can enhance their likability and connection with others, much like Ellen DeGeneres. So, whether it's through self-deprecation, poking fun, or participatory games, the aim is to make humor a natural element of communication.
