In a world fascinated by victory, especially in debates, there's a common misconception that "destroying" someone in an argument equates to true success. However, a more nuanced approach suggests that winning should focus on problem-solving rather than demolishing the opposition. Inspired by Jordan Peterson's discussions with Sam Harris, this post explores effective strategies for constructive debates.

### The Pitfall of "Winning"

In many debates, participants aim to "win" by verbally besting their counterpart, but this approach can be detrimental. **Winning an argument isn't synonymous with solving the actual problem.** Not only does it risk long-term damage to relationships, but it also shifts focus away from constructive dialogue.

### Establishing Common Ground

A vital step in any disagreement is to identify mutual agreements before diving into differences. By acknowledging areas of consensus, individuals become more receptive to alternate viewpoints. **Example:** In a Vancouver discussion, Peterson began by highlighting common beliefs with Sam Harris, which facilitated a more open dialogue.

### Seek to Understand Before Being Understood

Peterson demonstrates that truly engaging with someone's point involves expanding on it and showing understanding. This approach encourages the other party to remain open to new perspectives. **Example:** By elaborating on a student's assertion about hate speech laws' consequences, Peterson effectively positioned the student to consider new ideas.

### Phrase Feedback Carefully

The language used in feedback can transform a potentially contentious discussion into a productive one. Instead of stating "you're wrong," introduce counterpoints with language that invites collaboration, such as "it seems like" or "from my perspective."

### Detach Ego from Ideas

Arguments often escalate due to personal identification with ideas. Separating one's ego from their views can lead to more thorough, reasoned discussions. This practice requires recognizing that opinions are subject to change without altering one's core identity.

**Example:** Peterson often separates the concept of "the argument" from the "individual," allowing room for growth and preventing defensiveness.

### Dispute with Integrity

When disagreements arise, reaffirm good intentions to maintain a constructive atmosphere. **Example:** By clarifying his intentions not to "trap" during discussions, Peterson fosters an environment of mutual respect, essential for genuine understanding.

### Conclusion: Beyond Winning

Ultimately, the goal in any debate should not be to win, but rather, to *get it right*. This mindset fosters deeper understanding and personal growth. As Peterson insightfully remarks:

> "Even if the person you're talking to isn't very nice, the possibility exists that you could learn more than you knew before, and that's something worth seeking."

Approaching arguments with curiosity and openness doesn't just defuse potential conflicts; it also enriches your understanding and relationships.

### Reflective Question

Before your next debate, ask yourself: "Do I want to BE RIGHT, or am I committed to getting it RIGHT?" This perspective shift could spell the difference between ephemeral triumph and enduring wisdom.
