In the wake of global events, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky has emerged as a charismatic and influential leader, rallying international support in the conflict against Russia. Without delving into the politics, his leadership provides valuable insights into commanding respect and inspiring others, whether in business, politics, or daily life. Below are five leadership habits drawn from Zelensky’s approach that can empower you to be a more effective leader.

### 1. Align Interests for Mutual Benefit

To inspire others to follow, it is crucial to *show them* how supporting your goals aligns with their own interests. Rather than emphasizing your needs, highlight what they stand to gain. **Example:** If you’re a CEO inviting someone to join your company, instead of saying "I want you on board," frame the opportunity around their potential growth and achievement within the company.

Zelensky has shrewdly highlighted the "domino effect" and potential consequences if Ukraine falls, effectively motivating international support by illustrating a shared interest.

### 2. Use Dual Motivation: Heaven and Hell

Communicate both the benefits of siding with you and the consequences of not. This dual approach can drive commitment beyond momentary change.

In his addresses, Zelensky emphasizes the rewards for allies and the costs for those who support opposition forces, akin to Steve Jobs' famous pitch to John Sculley: **"Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life or come with me and change the world?"** Such narratives entice commitment by envisioning a greater purpose.

### 3. Elevate with Praise

People are more likely to aspire to greater heights if early, developing traits are recognized and praised. Highlight small acts of courage and character to encourage further contribution.

Zelensky praises European leaders for their support and the youth for rallying behind Ukraine. Rather than demanding more, he celebrates small contributions, which paradoxically fosters greater engagement.

### 4. Praise Publicly

Public acknowledgment encourages others to earn similar recognition. Highlighting accomplishments and contributions can spur increased efforts and stronger alliances.

Zelensky frequently acknowledges those aiding Ukraine on social media, from global corporations to individual soldiers. This public praise incentivizes continued and expanded support while avoiding the stifling effects of leadership wedded to fear of error.

### 5. Lead by Example

As a leader, your actions set the standard. Demonstrating commitment and integrity inspires others to embody these traits.

Zelensky's refusal to evacuate Kyiv and his visible support for Ukrainian soldiers exemplify personal commitment. The leader's character invariably shapes the organizational culture. **Example:** A manager who consistently exemplifies teamwork and dedication will likely foster a collaborative and motivated team.

In essence, leadership demands more than words—it requires personal commitment and the ability to align others with a shared vision. By adopting these habits, leaders can cultivate environments where individuals are motivated and inspired to contribute their best. Embrace these lessons to enhance your leadership capability and drive impactful change.
