The second and third presidential debates have concluded, and amidst all the discussions about who emerged victorious, there's an interesting angle to consider: charisma. This analysis focuses not on policies or argumentative strength, but on the elements of charisma demonstrated by the candidates during these debates.

### The Dynamics of Previous Primaries

Past debates, notably during the primaries, were often characterized by short, impactful remarks or "zingers", particularly from Donald Trump:

> "...and she said things WikiLeaks that just came out and she lied. Now she's blaming the lie on the late great Abraham Lincoln. That’s one that I have."

These moments were crowd-pleasers, igniting audience reactions and framing debate narratives. However, the dynamics shifted in the latest debates, where zingers took a backseat to more substantial dialogue, due to audience restrictions and the format allowing longer answers.

### Credibility Through Specificity

A key principle in these debates was **credibility**. Candidates used specific numbers to project authority:

- **Example:** "We have 33,000 people a year who die from guns..."

These figures, whether in the context of gun deaths or immigration statistics, attempt to bolster a candidate's perceived expertise. However, specificity should not be mistaken for truth, as these numbers lack context and grounding for many viewers.

### Comfort with Difficult Questions

Credibility also hinges on how candidates handle challenging questions. A strategy employed by both was to provide brief answers before redirecting:

- **Example:** "...if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy..."

These redirections often shift scrutiny back onto opponents or other issues but can backfire if perceived as evasive. Trump's failure to convincingly address some queries highlighted this risk, making him appear overwhelmed:

> Moderator: "If you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?"

The inability to provide direct answers can erode perceived credibility and authority.

### Mastering Conviction and Congruency

Conviction in one's stance is crucial to charismatic credibility. While Trump altered his usual animated presentation for a calmer demeanor, attempting a more "presidential" look, it occasionally detracted from his perceived conviction:

- **Example:** "...I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now."

In contrast, moments of strong conviction generally bolster candidate charisma.

### Emotional Connection Through Storytelling

Finally, crafting an emotional connection with the audience proved vital. Hillary Clinton succeeded partly through detailed storytelling, painting vivid emotional pictures:

- **Example:** "...a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who was very worried that her parents might be deported..."

These narratives foster empathy and relatability, whereas general references—often seen in Trump’s approach—may lack personalization.

Hillary also effectively engaged individuals by directly addressing their questions in town-hall formats, establishing a stronger emotional rapport.

### Conclusion: Charisma Over Zingers

Overall, from a pure charisma standpoint, these debates saw Hillary Clinton emerge more favorably by leveraging storytelling, maintaining credibility, and connecting emotionally with viewers. Although Trump was effective with zingers, their impact was lessened in this debate format. Engaging more triggers of charisma, Hillary edged out in the final two debates.

While charisma plays a noteworthy role in shaping public perception, it is essential to consider all facets when evaluating a candidate's debate performance.
