### Introduction to Debate Tactics

Ben Shapiro has established himself as a remarkable figure in political debate, recognized for his quick wit and persuasive rhetoric. Understanding and adopting some of his techniques can enhance the effectiveness of one's argumentation, irrespective of the position one holds.

Here are seven debate techniques evident in Shapiro's style that can assist anyone in elevating their debating skills.

### Caveats on Debating

- **Debate vs. Relationships:** Remember that debate is different from interpersonal relationships; while debate aims for winning, relationships often aim for unity and understanding.
- **Research is Key:** Solid research forms the backbone of debate, but the focus here will be on rhetorical tactics.

### Key Techniques in Defensive Debating

#### 1. Identifying Non-Arguments

Not everything persuasive forms a valid argument. When someone leans on authority or popularity, additional evidence is needed to make a point compelling.

**Example:** "We urge you to listen to the American public and support a ban on these weapons. That was Ronald Reagan." Shapiro's retort was, "Okay, so now I can disagree with Ronald Reagan." This points out the fallacy of argument from authority.

#### 2. Emotional Diversion

Arguments fueled by emotion don't equate to validity. A calm approach can deflate emotionally charged diversions.

**Example:** In a debate with Piers Morgan, Shapiro didn't respond emotionally to accusations of exploiting tragedy.

#### 3. Focusing on Specifics

Generalizations can muddy debate waters. Pressing opponents to put forth specific claims helps ensure clarity.

**Example:** Instead of addressing broad accusations about institutional racism, asking for specific instances or institutions can focus the argument.

#### 4. Sticking to Core Points

It’s crucial to defend only the necessary points of an argument without being led into tangential issues.

**Example:** When discussing Trump's media strategies, Shapiro kept the focus on the strategy rather than the morality of the actions.

### Offensive Debate Strategies

#### 5. Snuck Premises

Sneaking an assumption into the premise can subtly tilt an argument in your favour without overt dispute.

**Example:** Referring to abortion as "killing babies" implies a stance on personhood, steering opponents into unintended agreement with that perception.

#### 6. Moving From Abstract to Concrete

Shifting from broad principles to specific examples can effectively illustrate points, making arguments more relatable.

**Example:** Addressing income inequality by comparing diverse economic statuses on a global scale can illustrate disparities more vividly.

#### 7. Conditional Agreement

Outlining conditions under which you would agree with your opponent can present an openness to dialogue, sometimes serving as a strategic diversion.

**Example:** In discussions about impeachment, Shapiro emphasized his openness to changing his stance if evidence is presented, though this tactic can sometimes divert the opponent’s focus to meeting those conditions.

### Conclusion

The mastery of rhetorical strategies, as demonstrated by Ben Shapiro, can help win debates even if one's position is challenging. Whether aspiring to win tactically or engage in robust discussion, these techniques provide valuable insights into effective debate.
