### The Journey to Manhood: A Universal Quest

Cultures around the globe have long believed that becoming a man is more than just a biological inevitability; it requires the navigation through several distinct stages. In recent times, discussions about masculinity have been further complicated by concerns over toxic masculinity. The TV series "Cobra Kai" offers an insightful look into this journey with its depiction of evolving masculinity across four main stages.

### Boyhood: The Initial Stage

**Example:** Characters like Miguel, Eli, and Demetri illustrate the first stage of boyhood at the start of "Cobra Kai." These characters are awkward, uncomfortable in their own skin, and plagued by an absence of strong male role models. They struggle with bullying and lack direction, firmly believing that their middle school life is their destiny.

In this stage, the efforts of caring mothers to protect their sons sometimes backfire, inadvertently reinforcing the belief that the boys cannot fend for themselves.

### The Eager Student: Embracing Mentorship

The arrival of a mentor marks the second stage, where the boy becomes an eager student. Whether it’s a sensei, a book, or a lifestyle, this guidance offers solutions to the problems they face.

**Example:** Miguel stands up to a bully and gains respect, eventually dating his crush, thanks to the mentorship of Johnny Lawrence.

However, this stage can often lead to an uncritical adoption of masculinity's rules, some of which can be quite absurd or harmful, as adolescence seeks "coolness" based on transient societal norms.

### The Wanderer: Questioning the Rules

The third phase involves the recognition that blindly following every rule handed down can be damaging. It marks the transition to becoming a wanderer.

**Example:** Johnny begins to question the "no mercy" ethos that he once embraced, realizing its detrimental impact as he watches his son suffer.

This phase is crucial as it challenges entrenched ideas about masculinity, such as:

- **Believing anger is the only valid negative emotion.**
- **Valuing oneself based solely on romantic approval.**
- **Considering certain interests as "unmanly."**
- **Being defined by traits beyond one’s control, like height or sexuality.**

### The Free Thinker: Charting a New Course

As wanderers evolve, they become free thinkers in the fourth stage. They form personal belief systems informed by past lessons but adaptable to current circumstances.

> Instead of trying to become a man or prove masculinity, you're secure in the knowledge that your identity is yours to define.

In this stage, the aspiration is no longer to fit into external definitions of masculinity but to cultivate confidence and self-assuredness that isn’t defined by others' perceptions.

The exploration of manhood through "Cobra Kai" resonates beyond the screen, offering life lessons on personal growth applicable to all, irrespective of gender. By critically assessing the rules of masculinity and embracing a nuanced understanding, one can cultivate a more authentic personal identity. The journey suggests that true empowerment comes from within, advocating for a balance between adopting beneficial philosophies and discarding detrimental ones.

Reflecting on this journey as seen through the show's lens can inspire a more introspective approach to personal development.
