In the realm of dating, a common misconception often holds men back: the focus on impressing their partner rather than being their authentic selves. This mindset affects everything from the initial flirting phase right through to established relationships. While this is a mistake both genders can make, it's prevalent among men, driven by the desire to be liked by the other person.

### Understanding the Flawed Mindset

The erroneous belief is centered around tailoring one’s actions to win over the date. This includes:

- Choosing dining locations or activities that are out of character just to impress.
- Engaging in conversations that are perceived as "safe" rather than passionate.
- Adopting a "best foot forward" facade which is unsustainable long-term.

**Example:** You might find yourself choosing expensive restaurants or cooking elaborate meals that don't align with your true preferences, simply to avoid displeasing your date.

### The Long-term Implication

As time passes, following this path leads to unintended consequences. The relationship becomes strained due to:

- The constant pressure to maintain an unnatural persona.
- Resentment building due to personal sacrifices or unmet expectations.
- The truth of each person’s personality eventually emerging, leading to potential conflict over misaligned interests or false impressions.

### The Alternative Approach: Authentic Connection

The proposed solution involves adopting a more genuine approach from the beginning:

1. **Normalise the First Impression**
   - Present yourself as you truly are, even during initial encounters, to set realistic expectations.

2. **Date Within Your Means**
   - Choose activities or venues that reflect your true lifestyle and financial comfort.
   - Dress in a way that represents your daily fashion sense.

3. **Engage in Honest Conversations**
   - Discuss topics that are genuinely interesting to you, even if they are unconventional or personal.
   - Accept that these conversations may alienate some, but they will attract those who align with your true self.

**Example:** Rather than avoiding contentious topics like politics or religion if they are crucial to your identity, bring them up to ensure long-term compatibility.

### The Benefits of Authenticity

- **Reduced Effort**: Genuine interactions require less effort to maintain as they are naturally aligned.
- **Improved Compatibility**: Connections based on true personalities tend to be more satisfying and sustainable.
- **Personal Growth**: Developing yourself for your own betterment enhances all areas of life, not just dating.

### Avoiding the "Dating Persona"

It’s crucial to recognize whether a separate "dating persona" has developed. A tell-tale sign is needing to alter or halt conversations when transitioning between social circles.

**Example:** If altering your behavior around your partner compared to when you’re with friends, it might be indicative of a persona split.

In summary, this approach might lead to fewer second dates but fosters deeper connections built on authenticity. It encourages a shift from trying to impress to seeking compatible partners who appreciate and connect with the real you.
