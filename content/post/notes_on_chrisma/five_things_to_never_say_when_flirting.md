Navigating the art of flirting can feel like a labyrinth when society offers no formal classes to guide us. However, by avoiding certain phrases, it's possible to approach flirting with more confidence and finesse. Here are five things you should never say when flirting, along with tips on what to do instead.

## 1. Disqualification of Competition

When you encounter someone attractive, it's natural to feel a sense of competition, especially if they mention a celebrity crush or a friend's good looks. A common mistake is to make derogatory comments, like saying someone appears too handsome or making assumptions about their orientation.

Instead, show that you're secure in your own value. **Example:** If a crush mentions a celebrity, say, *"Yes, they do have a great style,"* followed by highlighting what makes you unique. This doesn't just represent confidence; it suggests you're confident enough to appreciate others.

## 2. Overuse of Enthusiastic Compliments

Repeatedly using phrases like "That's amazing" for everything someone says can come off as insincere and needy. Genuine compliments are essential, but everything shouldn't be described as "amazing."

Highlight sincere appreciation selectively and incorporate humor. **Example:** If someone shares a captivating story, respond with, *"Wow, you're a real-life superhero - tell me there's not a hidden cape somewhere!"* This approach maintains your enthusiasm and adds charm with a touch of playful sarcasm.

## 3. Vague Requests for Future Meetings

The ambiguous "Should we go out sometime?" often translates to "never" in reality. To avoid the pitfall of an indefinite "date," always aim for specific plans.

**Example:** Instead of a loose proposal, suggest something concrete, such as, *"There's a new art exhibit on Friday around 7 PM. Would you like to join me?"* This not only sets clear expectations but also increases your chances of a successful outing.

## 4. Abstract Contact Requests

Requesting contact details without a solid plan in place can be off-putting. Such requests can seem less like a genuine interest and more of a routine collection of contacts.

Make tangible plans first, then request contact details. **Example:** Upon firming up a time and place for a meetup, comfortably segue into, *"To confirm details, what's the best way to reach you?"* This conveys purpose and clarity in your intentions.

## 5. Conditional Compliments on Appearance

Comments like "You'd look better if you smiled" or suggestions for physical changes come across as critiques rather than compliments. They can make the other person self-conscious and reluctant.

It's crucial to avoid suggestions of improvement unless explicitly asked for advice. **Example:** Compliment the present attributes instead, saying something like *"Your natural style is quite charming."* This fosters positive feelings and aligns with supportive communication.

By eliminating these counterproductive approaches, your interactions will become more meaningful, genuine, and ultimately successful.
