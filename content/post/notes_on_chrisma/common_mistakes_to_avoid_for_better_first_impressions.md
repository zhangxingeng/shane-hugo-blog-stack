First impressions can significantly impact interpersonal interactions, as demonstrated by the captivating yet disastrous pitch on *Shark Tank* by Manish Sethi. Examining his experiences reveals five common mistakes that can decrease your likability and how you can avoid them for better outcomes.

### The Importance of First Impressions

Manish's pitch set off on the wrong foot due to a lack of **eye contact** and a **monotone voice**. Studies suggest that first impressions are formed within seven seconds. In this limited timeframe, displaying confidence through eye contact and a pleasant demeanor can provide a favorable edge.

**Example:** Imagine walking into an interview without looking at your interviewer and speaking flatly versus entering with a welcoming smile and engaging voice. The latter would certainly resonate better with the interviewer.

### Handling Laughter and Criticism

One significant moment during Manish's pitch was his defensive reaction to the judges' laughter. Accusatorily defending your ideas rather than embracing a shared humor moment can create unnecessary tension.

**Example:** If your friend laughs at a story you share, reacting with "Yes, it sounds funny, but wait for the punchline!" maintains a light, engaging atmosphere rather than turning defensive or combative.

### Transparency and Honesty

Ensuring transparency about your product or personal storytelling is crucial. Avoid appearing as though you're hiding weaknesses. Manish stumbled when his claims seemed to overstretch the truth, increasing skepticism.

Instead, admitting imperfections while providing tangible proof, like a satisfied "customer testimonial," can bridge the credibility gap.

### Understanding the Question Behind the Question

Many fail to address the underlying inquiries people have in conversations. It's important to identify and respond to unspoken concerns.

**Example:** When asked, "Why did you leave your last job?", a potential employer might be asking whether your past experience is relevant and if your decision-making aligns with their company values.

### Handling High-Pressure Situations

High-pressure scenarios can lead to miscommunication, as demonstrated by Manish's response to an offer on *Shark Tank*. Carefully planning your response to known, complex questions can prevent slip-ups.

**Example:** If rejecting a job offer because it doesn't align with your values, citing specific company aspects you admire but do not agree with provides clarity and maintains a positive relationship.

### Conclusion

A pitch like Manish's reveals critical lessons about communication in high-stakes environments. By maintaining eye contact, embracing humor, being honest, answering deeper questions, and effectively preparing for difficult interactions, we can elevate our personal and professional relationships.

By sidestepping these fundamental mistakes, we enhance our charisma and, ultimately, our chances of successfully forging strong connections.

### Additional Note

While forming quick first impressions is innate and hardwired, incorporating these strategies consistently can reshape how others perceive us, making each interaction positively memorable.
