In the world of politics, charisma can often be the deciding factor for undecided voters. When faced with unfamiliar or conflicting information, individuals tend to rely on their instincts and may be swayed by candidates who exude a certain allure or charisma. In the recent presidential debate, both Trump and Hillary Clinton presented themselves with varying degrees of charisma, each exhibiting strengths and weaknesses that played crucial roles in how audiences perceived them.

## Trump's Charismatic Approach

Trump demonstrated some effective charismatic techniques initially, most notably through his use of repetition, **example:** "Our jobs are fleeing the country..." This tactic ensures that the key points stick in the minds of the audience, creating lasting impressions that extend beyond the immediate aftermath of the debate.

However, as the debate progressed, his continuous interruptions of Clinton became increasingly abrasive, diminishing his charismatic appeal. In smaller, previous debates with multiple candidates, this approach had proven effective. **Example:** During earlier debates when interruptions led to audience laughter and applause. Yet, in a two-person debate where the moderator maintained control, these interruptions appeared excessive and off-putting.

Trump also exhibited non-verbal mistakes, such as acknowledging points made by Clinton with nods, unintentionally supporting her statements to the audience. This body language distracted from the strong rhetorical points he attempted to make.

## Hillary's Challenges and Recovery

Hillary Clinton's opening remarks felt overly scripted, with frequent verbal hitches indicating her struggle to remain on script. This approach detracted from her ability to appear personable and relatable. **Example:** Hesitations when reiterating her points about raising the national minimum wage.

Her efforts to become more authentic were hampered by memorizing points too rigidly, a reminder to avoid word-for-word preparation unless one has substantial acting prowess.

Despite initial flubs, Clinton found her footing, delivering spontaneous and witty retorts that effectively resonated with the debate flow, **example:** Quipping at Trump's tax records. However, this was overshadowed by her adherence to pre-packaged lines that stunted the debate’s momentum.

## Social Proof and Audience Response

The concept of **social proof**—where people are influenced by how others react—played a significant role. Unlike Trump's previous success with crowd reactions, a silent audience during this debate made his more abrasive tactics fall flat.

This scenario mirrored sitcoms without laugh tracks; missing auditory cues can prompt viewers to question the intended emotional response to a statement.

## Conclusion: A Closely Contested Charismatic Showdown

Neither candidate truly dominated from a charisma standpoint. Trump's more persuasive moments were offset by disruptive behavior, while Clinton's aspiring relatable moments often felt cumbersome due to excessive scripting.

**Example:** A comparison of the two styles showcases the complexities of public political personas. While Trump's speech felt more relaxed, Clinton brought moments of genuine engagement despite her struggles at first to connect on a personal level.

The charisma contest was close, yet no decisive winner emerged. As future debates approach, observing further adaptations could provide insight into shifts in both campaign strategies and charismatic techniques.
