Ragnar Lothbrok is a legendary character from the television series "Vikings," known for commanding immense respect and rising from a simple farmer to a king. Exploring Ragnar's traits reveals insights into commanding respect and achieving greatness.

### Ambitious Goals

One of Ragnar's primary tactics for earning respect is his ambition. He sets goals that others want to be a part of and pursues them relentlessly.

**Example:** When Ragnar planned to invade Paris, he devised an audacious plan to carry boats up a cliff, a feat never attempted by any Viking. Even rival kings praised this boldness, acknowledging the ambition and the vision behind it.

**Insights:**

- Avoid setting small, ego-protective goals.
- Pursue something that distinguishes you and attracts others.

### Focus on "We" Rather Than "Me"

Ragnar effectively addresses his followers' desires by emphasizing collective success instead of focusing solely on personal victories.

**Example:** After raiding England successfully, Ragnar uses inclusive language to motivate his team to return, highlighting the shared benefits.

**Insights:**

- Use "we" to articulate how your goals align with othersâ€™ aspirations.
- Paint a vision where everyone can see their own success.

### Projecting Calm in Conflict

Ragnar commands respect by maintaining calm and composed demeanor, especially during confrontations.

**Example:** When faced with enemy soldiers or his brother's threats, Ragnar's slow movements and relaxed body language project unwavering confidence, defusing tension without escalating conflicts.

**Insights:**

- Keep eye contact and maintain a steady, low voice.
- Calm reactions display confidence and can de-escalate conflicts.

### Leading From the Front

Ragnar demonstrates leadership by being in the thick of action during battles and sharing the risks with his companions.

**Example:** Even when others volunteer for dangerous tasks, Ragnar insists on sharing the burden, ensuring he matches or exceeds their efforts.

**Insights:**

- Lead by example to earn respect from peers or subordinates.
- Show that you aren't asking more of others than you're willing to do yourself.

### Compassion in Leadership

Ragnar's leadership isn't just about courage; it's also about empathy and compassion.

**Example:** When an elder wishes to die with honor in battle, Ragnar, despite the risks, respects the elder's request, earning admiration from others.

**Insights:**

- Make decisions that may entail personal risks but benefit others.
- Apply the golden rule even with those considered competitors or enemies.

In summation, these principles from Ragnar Lothbrok's leadership can shape the way one commands respect in various spheres of life, from the workplace to personal relationships. By pursuing ambitious goals, uniting people with common visions, projecting calm, leading courageously, and acting with compassion, anyone can cultivate the respect and admiration Ragnar achieved in "Vikings."
