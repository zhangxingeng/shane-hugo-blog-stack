When it comes to captivating personalities in Hollywood, Tom Hanks stands out effortlessly. His charm stems not simply from what he says, but how he articulates his ideas. Even if your topics of conversation are not particularly riveting, adopting some of Tom's communication habits can help ensure you are never boring.

## Launching Conversations with Story Gaps

Tom Hanks is adept at generating interest right from the beginning of a conversation by using *story gaps*. This technique involves starting with a subtle hint that raises a question, pulling listeners in:

> *"Wait, how did he get screwed?"* You instantly want to know more.

**Example:** Instead of saying, "You'll never believe how normal my day was," opt for something with more emotional stakes: "You're not going to believe what just happened, it changed everything!"

The idea is to open with a mystery, ideally with emotional stakes involved, to keep people intrigued.

## Inhabiting Characters and Actions

Tom continues to command attention by fully inhabiting the characters and actions he describes. Whether through his facial expressions, accents, or gestures, he ensures there is more of interest beyond the literal words spoken.

**Example:** If narrating a running experience, use your arms to mimic running. If discussing playing the guitar, strum an air guitar during your story.

This immersive storytelling is more engaging and holds listener attention.

## Utilizing Dynamics in Conversation

Being fascinating isn't just about high-energy delivery—it involves playing with conversational dynamics, such as adjusting gesture size, volume, and tone to fit the narrative mood.

> "I always run up and do bits, aiming just at you," showcases how varying dynamics catch and maintain interest.

By adjusting your delivery in a conversation—shifting from high to low energy or from serious to comedic—you can maintain engagement, avoiding an overwhelming onslaught of the same tone.

## Including Multiple Members

Lastly, Tom ensures that conversations are inclusive, engaging multiple members of a group. Attention is increased when individuals feel spoken to directly:

- Greet individuals by name when entering a room.
- Positively call out individuals or ask them questions to make them feel part of the conversation.

In larger groups, maintain eye contact to create the feeling of direct conversation. Aim for roughly three seconds of eye contact with individuals or sections of a room.

By adopting these habits, even mundane topics become intriguing, and discussions become more inclusive and engaging.
