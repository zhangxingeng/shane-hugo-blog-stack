### Understanding the King Archetype

The King archetype represents a deep well of **unconscious power, authority, and confidence** which individuals can access. By connecting with this energy through various symbols, myths, and stories, a person can unlock hidden power. The King archetype encourages an *inner confidence* that is impervious to external opinions.

> "Any man who must say I am the king is no true king."

### Characteristics of Mature King Energy

#### 1. Non-reactive Confidence

- A mature King does not need to react to insults or seek validation from others.
- This confidence is deeply intrinsic and not dependent on external approval.
- **Example:** A king remains unfazed even when his right to the throne is questioned; his sense of self is not reliant on others' opinions.

#### 2. Inspirational and Creative Influence

- King energy inspires others to feel confident and capable.
- It encourages creative solutions and expansive thinking beyond mere survival.

> "There is always hope."

#### 3. Love Over Opposition

- Kings define themselves by what they stand for, rather than what they stand against.
- Staying focused on positive goals helps avoid getting stuck in oppositional defiance.

**Example:** An entrepreneur motivated by passion for innovation rather than merely escaping the corporate rat race.

#### 4. Supportive Without Overbearing

- The King supports others' growth without taking on their burdens, avoiding the pitfalls of the "boy hero" syndrome.
- This balance prevents dependency and encourages self-reliance in others.

### Foundation of King Energy: Clear Seeing

- Seeing the world as it is without projection or distortion fuels the King energy.
- Commitment to clear seeing involves understanding oneself and the world directly.

#### Types of Projection

**Negative Projection:**

- Attributing one's disowned negative traits to others.
- **Example:** Accusing someone of dishonesty because you struggle with it yourself.

**Positive Projection:**

- Attributing exaggerated positive traits to others due to personal insecurities.
- **Example:** Overlooking red flags in relationships because of a fear of being alone.

The antidote to projection is a process known as **Shadow Work**â€”integrating disowned aspects of the self.

### Courage and Openness to Feel

- Commit to feeling emotions fully to eliminate compulsive avoidance behaviors.
- Embracing all of oneself, including vulnerability, leads to sustainable and growing confidence.

By continuously nurturing these aspects, the King archetype helps foster a robust and inspiring confidence that not only enhances personal growth but affects and elevates those around as well.
