### Understanding the Need for External Approval

Caring about what others think is a **natural instinct**. It's there to help us integrate into society. However, problems arise when this concern becomes overwhelming, leading to anxiety and a sense of mediocrity. This is because:

- The "average" lifestyle may not lead to happiness, and following the crowd isn't always the best decision.
- Prioritizing others' opinions can make people lose touch with their own natural confidence and joy.

### Living a Life True to Yourself

A common sentiment among those nearing the end of their lives is regret for not living a life true to themselves. It's crucial to care less about external validation and prioritize what genuinely matters to you.

### Strategies for Reducing Concern about Others' Opinions

#### 1. Find What Truly Ignites Your Passion

Not everything can be a priority. Discover what matters to you more than the opinions of others.

**Example:** If you love painting, pursuing this interest might outweigh the fear of being judged as different or "odd."

#### 2. Visualize Your Ideal Life

Imagine your perfect day, your surroundings, and daily activities. If your actions lead you toward this vision, judgments will seem insignificant. Remember, negative opinions are often a result of the *crab mentality*, where people try to hold others back.

#### 3. Create a Supportive Inner Circle

Cultivate relationships with a select few whose opinions you value and trust. However, this should be seen as a step toward gaining confidence in your own value system.

### Embrace Core Values

Defining and committing to your core values—such as growth, contribution, or honesty—help distance your self-worth from others' perceptions.

**Example:** Sincerely voicing your thoughts, even if not widely accepted, can lead to authentic relationships based on real appreciation rather than superficial acceptance.

### Detaching from External Validation

#### 1. Leave the Validation Casino

Reduce dependence on social media and its dopamine-driven feedback loop. Instead, embrace the philosophy that happiness originates from within.

#### 2. Adopt a Mindset of Certain Influencers

Those like Andrew Tate focus on controlling their reactions rather than relying on external validation.

### Self-Acceptance: The Ultimate Goal

Self-acceptance is critical in overcoming the impact of others' opinions. Achieve this by embracing your unique traits:

- Recognize that no one is perfect, and everyone has flaws.
- Accept that it's okay to be **weird**; often, what appears as "weirdness" is our uniqueness shining through.

**Example:** When teased for engaging in unpopular hobbies like playing video games, self-acceptance allows you to remain unfazed.

### Balancing Self-Acceptance with Growth

Some worry that self-acceptance may lead to complacency. However, genuine self-acceptance is acknowledging your current state, which forms a real foundation for growth:

- Accept where you are without delusion.
- Use acceptance as a stepping stone for setting realistic growth targets.

Self-acceptance doesn't require loving your current situation but recognizing it without self-deception is essential.

### Conclusion

Embracing self-acceptance whilst reducing the focus on others' opinions can transform your life. It's not about narcissism but rather choosing to live life authentically while remaining empathetic and considerate of others. This journey of self-discovery and growth ultimately leads to living a life you can be proud of, unconstrained by the judgments and expectations of others.
