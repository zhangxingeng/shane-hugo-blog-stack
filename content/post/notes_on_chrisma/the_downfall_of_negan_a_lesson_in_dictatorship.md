**Introduction**  
In the gripping world of "The Walking Dead," power dynamics often dictate survival. Negan, one of the series' most formidable antagonists, wields his authority through a complex system of fear and favoritism. Despite his temporary success, the principles outlined in "The Dictator's Handbook" and CGP Grey's "Rules for Rulers" highlight a critical oversight that might lead to Negan's demise.

**Key Principles of Power**  
The control exercised by leaders like Negan hinges on several core principles:

- **Key Supporters**: It's essential to have powerful allies. Negan excels at this by grooming select individuals to maintain control over the masses. By persuading Rick, a key influencer in his community, Negan seeks to spread his influence effectively.
  - **Example:** Negan knows that controlling Rick will indirectly control Rick's entire group, echoing how real-world leaders recognize and manipulate key figures.

- **Distribution of Treasure**: By distributing resources among his inner circle, Negan ensures their loyalty and compels them to behave ruthlessly.
  - **Example:** The promise of a lavish lifestyle creates a powerful incentive to follow Negan's brutal regime.

- **Minimizing Key Supporters**: With resources limited, maintaining a small circle of influential supporters is advantageous. Negan enforces this by disarming other communities.
  - **Example:** By removing firearms from opposing communities, he diminishes their threat and dependence on outside resources.

**The Power of Association**  
Despite his meticulous control, Negan neglects a crucial aspect: the potential for inter-group communication. Dictators falter when they allow disparate groups to align and collaborate. Negan's insistence on mobility ironically facilitates this.

> "When people from different groups band together to air their grievances, the risk of rebellion grows."

- **Example:** By not keeping stricter watch on movements between groups, Negan inadvertently allows alliances to form that could spark rebellion.

**The Betrayal Within**  
Dictators often fall not solely due to public uprising but from betrayal within. Despite diligent resources and care towards his generals, Negan overlooks signs of disloyalty.

- **Example:** Dwight's refusal to accept luxurious offerings hints at his underlying discontent—a tell-tale sign of potential betrayal.

**Conclusion: The Inevitability of Collapse**  
Negan’s strategic missteps—allowing communication between groups and ignoring signs of discontent among his key supporters—forecast his downfall. Such dynamics reflect broader lessons about power structures within autocratic regimes. As "The Walking Dead" unfolds, it's likely that these very elements will contribute to the collapse of Negan's authoritarian reign.

The story of Negan serves as a chilling reminder of how fragile power can be when leaders ignore the subtle, yet detrimental, cracks in their command.
