### Introduction

Arguing with someone who refuses to listen can be incredibly frustrating. However, with the right strategies, it's possible to change minds without damaging relationships. Here are six tips to help you successfully persuade a stubborn person.

### 1. The Two-to-One Rule

Start by saying two things they will agree with before diving into your point of disagreement. This technique makes them more open to your argument by showing that there's more agreement than disagreement between you.

**Example:** Jon Stewart utilizes this strategy when discussing the backlash against Joe Rogan. He acknowledges egregious misinformation but argues that the overreaction to Rogan is a mistake, balancing agreement with disagreement to create a receptive environment.

### 2. Creating Consistency With a Principle

Find a similar situation where you both agree and use that underlying principle to support your argument.

**Example:** To persuade someone against censoring misinformation on Spotify, draw on the 2003 Iraq War analogy, where questioning mainstream narratives was crucial, despite being labeled as misinformation.

### 3. Maintaining a Calm, Conversational Tone

Your delivery is as important as the words you say. Maintain a calm and friendly tone instead of an aggressive one to appear more agreeable.

**Humorous Note:** Argue like you're sipping Earl Grey in a delicate teacup, not like you're bashing it over your adversary's head.

### 4. Prioritize Connection Over Winning

Don't steamroll a conversation to make your point. Allow for playful breaks and engage with levity.

**Example:** Jon Stewart gives an example with Joe Rogan's elk meat joke, showing the importance of going along with jokes to maintain rapport.

### 5. Clarify Before You Disagree

Ensure you understand their position by summarizing it before launching into your counterpoints. This shows respect and aids comprehension.

**Example:** Clarify by paraphrasing: “Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're saying...” to prevent misunderstandings and strawman arguments.

### 6. Debate Ideas, Not Terms

Avoid getting ensnared in semantics. Focus on discussing the actual ideas and concepts, not just the terminology.

**Example:** In a discussion about critical race theory, participants struggled over the term rather than discussing the substantive ideas behind it.

### Conclusion

Building rapport before and during an argument is key to persuasion. Assess the last time you changed your mind; engaging genuinely with opposing ideas is crucial.

Consider these strategies the next time you engage in a heated debate, and watch as stubbornness starts to melt away in the face of reasoned persuasion.
