### The Power of Simple Language

**Donald Trump is known for using simple language**. Studies have shown that he averages just one syllable per word and speaks at approximately a 4th grade reading level. A significant takeaway from this is that simple language can be more memorable and persuasive, sticking in one's mind like a catchy jingle.

Why does this work?

- **Cognitive Fluency Bias**: When language is easy to understand, people are more likely to believe it. Easy equals true in the minds of many.

**Example:** Consider how a politician repeating short, punchy phrases can create memorable and impactful statements. "Our leaders are stupid," is more emotionally charged and accessible than "Our leaders are incompetent." The simpler, more common words spike emotional response and reach a broader audience.

### The Drawbacks of Jargon

In contrast, jargon can alienate an audience, as it often seems like puffed-up speech that obscures meaning while conveying little. Jargon can be prevalent in fields such as consulting, law, or medicine, often serving to make insiders feel more clever than they might actually be.

**Recommendation:** Avoid letting workplace jargon slip into normal conversations unless your goal is to dull the listener's senses or make them unexpectedly ponder the void.

### The Precision of Big Words

Bigger words, though less universally understood, offer precision. The ability to paint a detailed picture in someone's mind can be quite potent.

**Example:** Russell Brand, when talking about his past, uses uncommon words to create a vivid, emotive picture: “nocturnal, crimson-lit, back alley.” These words lift the narrative from the mundane to the evocative.

### Communicating for Effect

Different scenarios may require different communication styles:

- Choose words your audience will understand and appreciate, aiming for precision when necessary.
- Avoid showing off vocabulary that may condescend or confuse your listener.

Balancing between various forms of expression can enhance one's communication skills, tailoring language to suit the particular audience. This approach calls for a versatile communicator ready to employ different linguistic strategies.

### Practicing Versatility in Speech

**Exercise for Speakers:** Try alternating between conversations for precision and those using broadly understandable language. Such practice could enhance your ability to select terms resonant with your audience.

In essence, it’s not just a matter of big words or small words; it’s about speaking in a way that resonates with and moves your audience. Your ability to adapt language accordingly, rather than blaming audience uncertainties, displays true communicative prowess.

### Conclusion

The key lies in adaptability and audience awareness. Words are not just tools for understanding but reflections of identity and intelligence. Mastery of comprehensive word choice enhances connection and influence, qualities every persuasive speaker should aim for.

**Final Thought:** Nimbleness in language is a skill worth honing, guaranteeing communication that is both clear and impactful.
