Creating a good laugh can be a wonderful way to connect with others and make your presence more enjoyable. Here are seven techniques to easily make people laugh and feel delighted in your company.

### 1. Say the Unexpected

When asked a question, consider what the expected answer might be, then answer with the opposite, especially if it's something most would never say aloud. This can lead to great laughter.

**Example:** Imagine being asked, "Do you enjoy being a parent?" Instead of simply saying "Yes," one might humorously quip, "It’s all right—I guess 3 a.m. grocery store visits keep life exciting."

### 2. Use Cartoon Logic

Whenever someone asks you a question, imagine you're within a cartoon and answer with that logic.

**Example:** If asked how you manage your children's tantrums on a plane, you might say, "Oh, I just carry a portable inflatable bounce house and let it do the magic!"

### 3. Double Down on the Joke

Once you get others laughing, enhance the humor by adding another layer. This takes a funny joke to the next level, establishing you as a funny individual.

**Example:** Following the comment on being proud of your parents, say, "Yes, my family tree even has the occasional grandmother, which coincidentally doubles as my neighbor."

### 4. Build on Someone Else's Joke

Giggle at someone else's joke, then add your twist to keep the laughs rolling.

**Example:** If a colleague jokingly announces their upcoming role as "lead water carrier," you could add, "And right afterwards, I’ll be heading the revolutionary team for an innovative umbrella hat parade."

### 5. Reverse Defense

When teased, don’t be defensive. Instead, reverse the situation to lighten the mood.

**Example:** If accused of being clueless about fashion, admit, "I’m actually the undercover fashion adviser for royal barn animals."

### 6. Use Fake Out Method

This method involves setting up an expectation and taking a different route to the answer.

**Example:** "Last night, I overheard a sound, went to check on my toddler, and found empty candy wrappers on the bed. Clearly, I’ve raised a prolific candy thief and not a bubble gum bearer."

### 7. Prepare Go-To Jokes

Think of common scenarios and prepare witty responses ahead of time. This is a favorite trick of many comedians.

**Example:** When repeatedly asked about your weekend plans, respond with, "Oh, the usual rounds of ‘is it Friday yet?’ while baking cakes shaped like philosophical questions."

Understanding these techniques helps integrate humor seamlessly into everyday interactions, making you a favorite among friends and acquaintances. Let your unique style shine as you choose which techniques fit your personality best, bringing joy and laughter to those around you. Happy joking!
