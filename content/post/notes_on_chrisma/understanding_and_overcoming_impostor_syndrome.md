## What is Impostor Syndrome?

Impostor Syndrome is a pervasive feeling of self-doubt that commonly arises when individuals attain new accomplishments, such as a job promotion or starting a relationship with someone they perceive as "out of their league." It tells individuals that they do not deserve their success. This mindset can lead to self-sabotage, causing individuals to regress to a more comfortable state that feels falsely authentic.

## The Mindset to Overcome Impostor Syndrome

A beneficial mindset to overcome this syndrome involves redefining expectations:

>"The world isnâ€™t expecting you to be the best, just to improve things in the way you promise you can."

By redefining the goal from being perfect to simply delivering on what you can actually offer, one removes the pressure of perfection and shifts focus to practical execution and improvement.

## Strategies for Combating Impostor Syndrome

### 1. Set Realistic Boundaries

Overstatement of capabilities is a common pitfall. Many people fall into the trap of saying "yes" to tasks outside their current expertise, leading to stress and potential failure. Drawing clear boundaries about what one can and cannot do is essential:

**Example:** A coach who feels comfortable with charisma coaching might avoid giving managerial advice outside their expertise, focusing instead on their strengths, like human incentives and psychology.

### 2. Take Stock of Past Achievements

It's crucial to assess past successes and failures objectively, understanding what feedback genuinely reflects one's abilities.

**Example:** Engaging with platforms like Reddit can offer harsh but honest feedback. Balancing both positive and negative criticism helps maintain a realistic perspective and boosts confidence in one's work.

### 3. Focus on Delivering Results, Not Credentials

The pursuit of credentials often overshadows the actual ability to produce tangible results. While credentials hold some value, delivering results should be the primary focus.

**Example:** An aspiring trainer should aim to show tangible improvements in clients' lives, rather than relying solely on certification.

## Conclusion

Impostor Syndrome can be a barrier to personal and professional growth. However, by employing realistic self-assessment, setting clear boundaries, and focusing on real-world results rather than credentials, individuals can overcome these feelings and make meaningful contributions to their fields. Understanding and embracing these concepts allows individuals to transition from impostors to effective, impactful contributors.
