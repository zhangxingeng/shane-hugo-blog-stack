In certain areas of life, particularly in professional settings, one may find themselves needing to persuade others to align with a change or idea. This scenario often presents challenges, as not everyone may agree with the proposed changes. Here, we delve into effective strategies for persuasion using a breakdown of Barack Obama's speech following a tragic event as an example.

### Identifying the Problem

The first crucial step in persuasion is introducing the problem to your audience and associating it with significant pain. Highlighting the unpleasant reality helps underscore the necessity for change.

**Example:** Barack Obama opens his speech by addressing the regularity of mass shootings and the inadequacy of thoughts and prayers alone. He underscores the continual heartache and grief, emphasizing that the status quo is unacceptable.

> "Our thoughts and prayers are not enough. It does not capture the heartache, and grief, and anger that we should feel..."

### Handling Objections

An effective persuader anticipates objections and addresses them proactively in their communication. By doing so, the argument gains strength and is less vulnerable to criticism.

**Example:** Obama skillfully counters potential objections regarding gun legislation by highlighting that many countries with mental illness issues do not experience such frequent mass shootings.

> "We are the only advanced country on earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months."

### Establishing Consistency

This step involves conveying that the proposed action path aligns with an audience’s identity and values. It’s about ensuring that what is being asked feels like a logical extension of their current beliefs and practices.

**Example:** Obama aligns himself with responsible gun owners, emphasizing responsible legislation rather than drastic actions.

> "There are scores of responsible gun owners in this country. They know that's not true."

### Creating Ownership

Allow the audience to take personal ownership of the argument. This leads to stronger internalization of the message.

**Example:** Obama suggests that media and citizens engage in tallying figures and comparing statistics, promoting personal involvement rather than placing emphasis on preaching.

> "News organizations tally up the number of Americans who've been killed through terrorist attacks... and post those side by side on your news reports."

### Making the Ask

Every persuasive attempt needs a clear "ask"—an earnest request for support or help, as persuasion is ultimately about creating willingness and personal buy-in.

**Example:** Obama seeks support from the public, emphasizing that change cannot happen in isolation.

> "I'd ask the American people to think about how they can get our government to change these laws..."

### Painting the Positive Outcome (Commonly Overlooked)

While Obama’s speech does not include this, a powerful persuasion technique involves vividly describing the future benefits of adopting the proposed changes. This creates a compelling vision that can motivate action.

By following these structured steps, persuasion becomes not about manipulation, but about fostering genuine shared understanding and mutual agreement on a path forward. These methods can significantly enhance the effectiveness of communication in various aspects of life.
