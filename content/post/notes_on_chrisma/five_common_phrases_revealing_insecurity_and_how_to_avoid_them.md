### Introduction

In conversation, the words chosen can significantly impact how others perceive confidence levels. Certain phrases, while seemingly innocuous, can inadvertently portray arrogance or insecurity, often leading to negative judgments. Here are five common phrases that might unintentionally reflect a lack of confidence and what to say instead.

### 1. "Obviously" and "I Already Knew That"

These phrases can condescendingly dismiss what someone else is sharing with you.

- **Why It's Detrimental:** Using these statements after someone shares something interesting undermines their perspective and elevates your own, suggesting superiority.
- **Alternative Approach:** Convey shared curiosity by linking similar experiences or insights without claiming pre-existing knowledge.
  
  **Example:** "That's fascinating! I was reading a book on the same theme recently."

### 2. "You Should"

Advisory phrase often perceived as prescriptive and overbearing.

- **Why It Doesn't Work:** Suggests understanding a person's life completely, including their challenges and goals.
- **Alternative Approach:** Use conditional language to share advice without asserting authority.

  **Example:** "If your situation is similar to mine, you might find this approach helpful."

### 3. "Real"

The use of "real" as a qualifier for genuine attributes or actions.

- **Why It Alienates:** Establishes a narrow view where only one version of reality is legitimate, dismissing alternative perspectives.
- **Suggestion:** Rethink using the phrase "real" to avoid invalidating others' views or experiences.

### 4. "No But"

A phrase often heralding instant contradiction in discussions.

- **Why It's Counterproductive:** Immediately negates another person's point, potentially making them feel attacked.
- **Alternative Approach:** Use phrases like "It seems like" or "It sounds like" to validate before offering your differing opinion.

  **Example:** "It sounds like you're saying…" followed by a reflective summary of their point.

### 5. "More Difficult Than"

A phrase comparing the difficulty of tasks or roles between people.

- **Why It’s Perceived as Arrogant:** Assumes one's challenges are inherently tougher, overlooking others' hidden struggles.
- **Alternative Approach:** Compare only personal experienced situations and acknowledge subjective differences.

  **Example:** "In my experience, I found role X more challenging than role Y, though others might feel differently."

### Conclusion

Language is a powerful tool that can either bridge or widen communication gaps. By adopting these alternatives, interactions stand to become more inclusive and empathetic. Mindfulness of phrasing can significantly influence others' perceptions, fostering better conversations and relationships.
