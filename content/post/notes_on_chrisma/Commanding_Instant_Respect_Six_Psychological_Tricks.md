Earning respect traditionally requires a long time commitment to showcasing strong character and integrity, but certain psychological tricks can expedite this process significantly. Explore six effective methods to command respect more immediately.

### 1. Upgrade Your "Thin Slice"

The concept of a "thin slice" refers to the instantaneous judgment people form about you within the first five seconds of meeting. **Example:** Imagine seeing someone for the first time and immediately liking them, akin to first impressions of Ryan Gosling in *Crazy Stupid Love*.

**Tips to Enhance Your Thin Slice:**

- **Dressing One Level Up:** Dress one step above the occasion. This doesn't mean becoming a fashion victim but selecting attire that makes a subtle statement.
- **Choose Clothing That Fits Well:** Focus on brands that complement your body type rather than opting for the most expensive attire available.

### 2. Physically Take Up More Space

Your physical presence can greatly enhance respect. Holding a commanding posture or using space effectively can make a profound impression.

**Example:** Observing Tony Robbins as he manages the stage with expansive gestures and space.

**Non-Invasive Space Use:**

- **Good Posture:** Roll your shoulders back, increase the space between your ribs and hips, and stand taller.
- **Occupying Your Space:** Sit asymmetrically or make full use of your seat space without overshadowing others.

### 3. Get Comfortable with Platonic Touching

Touch is imperative for building human connections, promoting trust, and generating a sense of safety. **Example:** See how Oprah uses touch to connect quickly and authentically.

**Principles of Appropriate Touching:**

- **Areas to Focus On:** Stick to the hands, arms, shoulders, and upper back.
- **Short Duration:** Keep touches under five seconds to avoid discomfort.
- **Universal Touching:** Be egalitarian, not just focusing on one individual.
- **Monitor Reactions:** Adjust according to the other person's comfort.

### 4. Speak Without Being Interrupted

When interrupted, continuing to speak can command respect without escalating into impoliteness. **Example:** Observe how Jaden Smith's youthful hesitance contrasts with Will Smithâ€™s assertiveness in conversation.

**Communication Focus:**

- Ensure your sentence completion, especially in group discussions, to maintain the conversation's integrity.
- Balance conversation without domineering monopolization.

### 5. Praise Your Competition

Counterintuitively, complimenting adversaries can amplify the respect others hold for you by demonstrating confidence and open-mindedness.

**Example:** Jordan Peterson articulates a rational appreciation for atheism amidst his own religious beliefs.

**In Professional and Personal Scenarios:**

- **Workplace:** Elevate colleagues by recognizing their work publicly.
- **Dating:** Avoid negative commentary about perceived competition to foster a positive self-image.

### 6. Share Your Shortcomings Openly

Despite common misconceptions, displaying one's flaws can significantly bolster respect. **Example:** Eminem utilizes this technique in *8 Mile*, transforming potential vulnerability into undeniable strength.

**Effective Sharing Techniques:**

- **Jocular Approach:** Use humor when referring to personal shortcomings.
- **Direct Admission:** State imperfections directly, maintaining eye contact and an even tone.

**Example:** Witness Brad Pitt's comedic self-awareness during an award acceptance, which reiterates his confidence.

While these strategies can enhance respect on their own, their effectiveness is intensified by pairing them with genuine self-confidence and authenticity. Developing these attributes can provide even longer-lasting and more natural results in commanding respect wherever you go.
