### Overview

At the end of July in the 2016 election race, Donald Trump was statistically tied in the polls with Hillary Clinton. However, in the week that followed, Trump's standing took a significant hit due to a series of persuasion mishaps. This post examines the mistakes made by Trump, how Clinton capitalized on those mistakes, and what both candidates needed to do to improve their standings.

### Trump's Persuasion Techniques

Donald Trump had effectively utilized various rhetorical techniques throughout his campaign. One notable method was the "others have said" technique:

- Trump regularly referenced unspecified others to voice controversial sentiments without taking direct ownership.
- **Example:** During the Republican primaries, he suggested "other people were saying" that Ted Cruz was ineligible to run for President, thereby spreading doubt while maintaining plausible deniability.

### The "Others Have Said" Technique Backfires

Trump's technique faltered spectacularly following a conflict with the Khan family:

> "The 'other people are saying' wasn't effective when applied to a gold star mother, especially post-nomination when public scrutiny had intensified."

This incident highlighted the limitations of using this tactic in situations where empathy and respect were paramount.

### Countering Trump's Rhetoric

Another challenge arose when Hillary Clinton's campaign devised a strategy to counter Trump's rhetorical style.

- **Example:** Clinton's team reframed Trump's sarcastic comments as sincere beliefs, pushing him into a rhetorical trap. When Trump claimed Obama "founded ISIS," Clinton calmly retorted on Twitter by stating, "No, Obama did not found ISIS."
- This situation put Trump in a dilemma: any attempt to clarify would either mean conceding error or doubling down on falsehoods.

### Shifting Public Perception

Hillary's campaign was also engaging in efforts to reshape her public image:

- Moving beyond "robotic" perceptions, her campaign aimed to humanize Clinton.
- **Example:** At the National Democratic Convention, Hillary's team showcased her as a relatable figure through videos depicting her as a mother and friend, which was strategic in enhancing her likability.

### Changes in Campaign Strategies

As the election matured:

- Trump needed to adapt by sticking more to prepared speeches and adopting a more cautious approach in delivering spontaneous remarks.
- Clinton's strategy focused on reinforcing her newfound relatability while making Trump appear as a catalyst for division.

### Conclusion

Both Trump and Clinton were adjusting their strategies in response to each other's plays. Trump's challenge was to recover the ground lost due to his famous "political incorrectness," while Clinton sought to retain her lead by seeming more approachable and trustworthy.

Their ongoing modifications suggested that strategies would continue evolving as the election pursued its course, promising that the upcoming debates would be pivotal in defining each candidate's appeal without the benefit of campaign teams.

In the kaleidoscope that is electoral politics, this evolving interplay between public perception and strategic messaging offers endless lessons in the realm of persuasion.
