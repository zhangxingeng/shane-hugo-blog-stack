In the field of positive psychology, character strengths represent the best qualities within us—our core capacities for thinking, feeling, and behaving in ways that benefit ourselves and others. Unlike skills that can be learned quickly, character strengths are deeper aspects of our personality that develop throughout our lives.

This post explores the 24 scientifically-validated character strengths, offering real-world examples of how each manifests in daily life. By recognizing and developing these strengths, you can enhance your personal growth, relationships, and overall wellbeing.

## Wisdom and Knowledge

These strengths involve acquiring and using knowledge in meaningful ways.

### 1. Creativity

**Definition:** Thinking of novel and productive ways to conceptualize and do things.

**Example:** A teacher who creates an interactive game that helps students learn mathematical concepts when traditional methods aren't working. Instead of relying on memorization, she develops a story-based adventure where students solve math problems to progress through different levels.

### 2. Curiosity

**Definition:** Taking an interest in ongoing experiences for their own sake; exploring and discovering.

**Example:** A software developer who spends weekends learning about marine biology simply because he finds ocean ecosystems fascinating. Despite having no professional reason to study the topic, his genuine interest drives him to read books, watch documentaries, and even volunteer at a local aquarium.

### 3. Open-mindedness

**Definition:** Thinking things through and examining them from all sides; weighing all evidence fairly.

**Example:** A community leader who listens carefully to opposing viewpoints on a controversial local development project. Rather than immediately siding with her initial preference, she actively seeks perspectives from all stakeholders, considers the long-term implications of different options, and changes her position based on compelling evidence.

### 4. Love of Learning

**Definition:** Mastering new skills, topics, and bodies of knowledge, whether on one's own or formally.

**Example:** A retired accountant who takes online courses in Renaissance art history, attends workshops on digital photography, and joins a Spanish language group. Learning itself—not credentials or professional advancement—is his primary motivation.

### 5. Perspective

**Definition:** Being able to provide wise counsel to others; having ways of looking at the world that make sense to oneself and to other people.

**Example:** A grandmother whose advice is sought by family members facing difficult decisions. Drawing from decades of experience, she helps them see situations from multiple angles and identify considerations they might have overlooked, without imposing her own preferences.

## Courage

These strengths involve exercising willpower to accomplish goals in the face of opposition.

### 6. Bravery

**Definition:** Not shrinking from threat, challenge, difficulty, or pain; acting on convictions even if unpopular.

**Example:** An employee who speaks up about unethical practices in her company despite knowing it might jeopardize her position. While colleagues remain silent out of fear, she brings documented concerns to leadership because her integrity matters more than comfort or security.

### 7. Persistence

**Definition:** Finishing what one starts; persisting in a course of action in spite of obstacles.

**Example:** A novelist who continues working on her manuscript despite receiving dozens of rejection letters from publishers. Rather than abandoning the project, she revises based on constructive feedback, improves her craft through workshops, and ultimately completes the book after three years of consistent effort.

### 8. Integrity

**Definition:** Presenting oneself in a genuine way; taking responsibility for one's feelings and actions.

**Example:** A manager who admits to his team that a project failed partly due to his poor planning. Instead of blaming external factors or team members, he acknowledges his role in the outcome, outlines what he learned, and describes how he'll approach similar situations differently in the future.

### 9. Vitality

**Definition:** Approaching life with excitement and energy; feeling alive and activated.

**Example:** A woman in her sixties who brings enthusiasm to everything from her morning swim to community volunteering to family gatherings. Her energy is contagious—people consistently remark that spending time with her leaves them feeling more motivated and engaged.

## Humanity

These strengths involve tending and befriending others.

### 10. Love

**Definition:** Valuing close relations with others, particularly those in which sharing and caring are reciprocated.

**Example:** A father who makes time each day to fully engage with his children despite work pressures. He creates meaningful rituals like weekend hiking trips and bedtime reading, listens attentively to their concerns, and consistently demonstrates that their wellbeing matters deeply to him.

### 11. Kindness

**Definition:** Doing favors and good deeds for others; helping without expectation of return.

**Example:** A neighbor who regularly shovels snow from elderly residents' driveways, delivers homemade meals during illness, and offers rides to medical appointments. She performs these acts not for recognition or reciprocation, but from genuine concern for others' wellbeing.

### 12. Social Intelligence

**Definition:** Being aware of the motives and feelings of other people and oneself.

**Example:** A team leader who notices when a usually enthusiastic colleague becomes quiet during meetings. Recognizing signs of distress that others miss, he creates appropriate opportunities for private conversation, adjusts expectations temporarily, and helps the team member navigate a difficult period without drawing unwanted attention.

## Justice

These strengths underlie healthy community life.

### 13. Citizenship

**Definition:** Working well as a member of a group or team; being loyal to the group.

**Example:** A volunteer firefighter who prioritizes training sessions, responds reliably to emergency calls, and helps maintain equipment. Beyond fulfilling her official responsibilities, she strengthens team cohesion by organizing social events and supporting newer members through their training.

### 14. Fairness

**Definition:** Treating all people according to notions of fairness and justice; not letting personal feelings bias decisions about others.

**Example:** A youth sports coach who gives equal playing time to all team members regardless of skill level. Despite pressure from some parents to favor the most talented players, he remains committed to developing everyone's abilities and ensuring each child has meaningful opportunities to participate.

### 15. Leadership

**Definition:** Encouraging a group to get things done while maintaining good relations within the group.

**Example:** A project manager who clearly articulates goals, assigns tasks based on team members' strengths, addresses conflicts constructively, and celebrates collective achievements. Her approach balances achieving objectives with supporting individual growth and fostering a positive team culture.

## Temperance

These strengths protect against excess.

### 16. Forgiveness and Mercy

**Definition:** Forgiving those who have done wrong; accepting others' shortcomings; giving people second chances.

**Example:** A man who rebuilds a relationship with his brother after years of estrangement following a business dispute. Rather than holding onto resentment, he acknowledges his brother's sincere apology, recognizes that everyone makes mistakes, and focuses on creating a healthier relationship moving forward.

### 17. Humility/Modesty

**Definition:** Letting one's accomplishments speak for themselves; not regarding oneself as more special than one is.

**Example:** A renowned scientist who deflects personal praise during an award ceremony, instead highlighting her research team's contributions and the work of predecessors in her field. Despite her exceptional achievements, she sees herself as part of a larger scientific community rather than seeking the spotlight.

### 18. Prudence

**Definition:** Being careful about one's choices; not taking undue risks; avoiding things one might later regret.

**Example:** A young professional who carefully researches investment options before committing his savings, weighs the pros and cons of job offers before accepting, and considers potential outcomes of major decisions. His thoughtful approach helps him avoid impulsive choices with long-term consequences.

### 19. Self-Regulation

**Definition:** Regulating what one feels and does; being disciplined; controlling one's appetites and emotions.

**Example:** A woman who maintains a regular exercise routine despite a busy schedule, practices meditation to manage stress, and limits social media use to specific times. Her discipline extends to emotional responses—when frustrated, she pauses before reacting to avoid words or actions she might regret.

## Transcendence

These strengths forge connections to the larger universe and provide meaning.

### 20. Appreciation of Beauty and Excellence

**Definition:** Noticing and appreciating beauty, excellence, and skilled performance in various domains of life.

**Example:** An urban commuter who pauses his hurried morning routine to watch the sunrise, regularly visits art galleries during lunch breaks, and attends community orchestra performances. He finds genuine joy in experiencing beauty and human achievement across different contexts.

### 21. Gratitude

**Definition:** Being aware of and thankful for good things; taking time to express thanks.

**Example:** A cancer survivor who keeps a daily gratitude journal, writes thoughtful thank-you notes to healthcare providers, and established a foundation to support other patients. Her gratitude isn't just about feeling thankful—it's an active practice that shapes how she lives and relates to others.

### 22. Hope

**Definition:** Expecting the best in the future and working to achieve it; believing a good future is possible.

**Example:** An environmental activist who remains optimistic despite discouraging climate reports. Rather than becoming paralyzed by negative projections, she envisions positive futures, develops practical sustainability initiatives, and inspires community action through her confident belief that meaningful change is possible.

### 23. Humor

**Definition:** Liking to laugh and tease; bringing smiles to others; seeing the light side of life.

**Example:** A hospital nurse who uses appropriate humor to ease patients' anxiety, diffuse tense situations among staff, and maintain perspective during challenging shifts. His playful approach doesn't diminish seriousness when needed, but creates moments of connection and relief in a high-stress environment.

### 24. Spirituality

**Definition:** Having coherent beliefs about the higher purpose and meaning of life; knowing where one fits within the larger scheme.

**Example:** A business executive who makes career decisions based on her core values rather than solely on financial gain. Whether through traditional religious practice, meditation, or philosophical reflection, she regularly connects with what she finds most meaningful, using these insights to guide both personal and professional choices.
