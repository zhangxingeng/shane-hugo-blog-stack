### Post Content original content

### Instructions

- Most important ideology: be reader-centric, when you write something, always assume you are writing for a real person. Consider what is this person thinking right now? what would confuse this person? What would be the question raised by this person at this point?
- rewrite the post content to make it more engaging and interesting, use plenty examples so reader can understand the content better, and trigger reader's natural curiosity.
- use concise and plain language, avoid using fancy words, which disenages human to read.
- use a relaxed and humorous tone but be elegant and professional. Don't try to be fake enthusiastic -- be genuine instead. Reader will know you the writer is truely excited about this when they see hints about deep thoughts and open questions (active engagement and ownership reveals true passion) while something like "Wow, this is amazing!" is just fake enthusiasm and no reader want to read that stuff. 
- be respectful but casual at the same time. treat the reader as equals and a friend.
- remember the system one and sytem two thinking: the expert (you) would think everything is easy because you are offloading most of the work to system one, while the reader who is not familiar with the knowledge would need to think about everything using system two and that is hard. So make sure you are really detailed and patient and use humor to attract the reader's attention and make them feel like they are not alone in the journey, and most importantly, make sure they can follow your steps and truely understand what is going on instead of being intimidated by the technical details.
