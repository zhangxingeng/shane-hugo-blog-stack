# Blog Post Rewriting Instructions

## Blog Writing Instructions

### Core Philosophy

Write as if you're having a genuine, intriguing conversation with someone right in front of you. What questions might they ask? What would puzzle or interest them? Engage their natural curiosity.

### Structure & Flow

1. **Socratic Hook:** Begin by raising intriguing questions, common misconceptions, or interesting mistakes. Spark genuine curiosity first—remember the Confucian wisdom: 不愤不启，不悱不发 ("If they are not eager, don't enlighten; if they don't struggle, don't explain.")
2. **Hook with Relatability:** Start with a moment readers recognize ("You know that feeling when...").
3. **Problem Exploration:** Vividly illustrate the confusion, error messages, or scenario. Show clearly why the question matters.
4. **Discovery Journey:** Guide readers through the exploration and investigation, including your missteps and "aha" moments.
5. **Progressive Understanding:** Introduce ideas gradually, building logically step-by-step.
6. **Clarity Payoff:** The solution or insight should feel both rewarding and clear, becoming obvious once understood.

### Writing Techniques

**Don't Start with Technical Details:**

If the content involves code or highly technical concepts, always begin with an analogy or relatable scenario before introducing technical specifics.

**Use Analogies that Stick:**

* Relate abstract ideas to familiar experiences
* "Python reads your file like a book—top to bottom"
* "It's like using a gift card for a store that hasn't opened yet"

**Make It Personal (But Not Self-Indulgent):**

* Share authentic struggles and insights
* Include real thought processes: "My first instinct was..." or "After hours of confusion..."
* Display vulnerability genuinely—readers relate deeply to honest human experiences

**Anticipate Reader Reactions:**

* "But wait, you might be thinking..."
* "You could wonder why this even matters..."
* Address skepticism proactively

**Code Examples that Teach:**

* Start simple, progressively build complexity
* Include explanatory comments reflecting developer thoughts
* Explicitly show common mistakes and explain why they happen

**Conditional Instructions for Specific Content Types:**

* **If the content includes code:**

  * Begin with a clear, relatable analogy
  * Start with simple code snippets, progressively building complexity
  * Include explanatory comments reflecting developer thoughts
  * Explicitly show common mistakes and why they happen

* **If the content is philosophical or psychological:**

  * Begin with an intriguing question or paradox
  * Illustrate ideas through thought experiments or relatable situations
  * Progressively deepen the reader's understanding with relatable examples

* **If the content is historical or cultural:**

  * Start with a fascinating historical anecdote or cultural misunderstanding
  * Build context gradually, helping readers see why historical context matters

* **If the content can be connected by a story:**

  * Use a relevant, engaging story throughout the post to thread and unify the content
  * Ensure the story is intriguing and relatable, clearly connecting dots to key insights or solutions
  * Use the narrative to enrich understanding and maintain reader engagement

### Tone Guidelines

* **Genuine over Enthusiastic:** Prefer authentic curiosity and thoughtful exploration over exaggerated excitement.
* **Humble Expertise:** You've learned something valuable; share it clearly so others can understand more easily.
* **Conversational but Clear:** Write like you're explaining a nuanced idea to an intelligent friend.
* **Humor that Reinforces:** Any humor used should support comprehension rather than distract from the main message.

### Technical Writing Tips (if applicable)

* **System 1 vs System 2 Thinking:** Remember, what feels intuitive to you requires deliberate thought from your reader.
* **Progressive Disclosure:** Reveal technical details precisely when they become relevant—not earlier.
* **The "Why Should I Care?" Principle:** Clearly connect technical points to practical outcomes or personal significance.

### Engagement Patterns

* Use frameworks readers know (like "Five Stages of Debugging")
* Create memorable section headers that tell a story
* Provide a final insightful thought that reshapes the reader’s perspective

### Categories & Tags Strategy

**Categories (hierarchical):**

* Primary: General field (Technology, Business, Psychology, Culture, etc.)
* Secondary: Specific topic (Web Development, Philosophy, Mental Health, History, etc.)

**Tags (15-20 keywords):**

* Key terms and concepts discussed
* Common misunderstandings or questions
* Tools, theories, or figures mentioned
* Skill or knowledge level indicators
* Related concepts for searchability

## Quality Checklist

* [ ] Would someone tired or distracted still find this clear and engaging?
* [ ] Would a tired developer at 3 PM find this helpful and engaging?
* [ ] Does each section maintain and deepen curiosity?
* [ ] Does each section earn the reader's continued attention?
* [ ] Are complex ideas introduced with simple analogies?
* [ ] Is the voice authentic and not performative?
* [ ] Does the conclusion offer closure and thoughtful inspiration?
